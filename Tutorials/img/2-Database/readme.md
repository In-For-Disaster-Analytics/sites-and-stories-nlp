| If there's one aspect gaining importance in the world of large language models, it's exploring how to leverage proprietary information with them. In this lesson, we explore a possible solution that involves storing information in a vector database, ChromaDB in our case, and using it to create enriched prompts. | [Article](https://pub.towardsai.net/harness-the-power-of-vector-databases-influencing-language-models-with-personalized-information-ab2f995f09ba?sk=ea2c5286fbff8430e5128b0c3588dbab) | [Notebook](https://github.com/peremartra/Large-Language-Model-Notebooks-Course/blob/main/2-Vector%20Databases%20with%20LLMs/how-to-use-a-embedding-database-with-a-llm-from-hf.ipynb)|
