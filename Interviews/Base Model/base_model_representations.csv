Oh, PER. So engineer firm is revitalizing a cost estimate, producing a technical memo to add on to the preliminary engineering report that\'s going to describe the cost estimate and I need deficiency language. I need to come up with some more bad pipe language. Like water pipes are bad in this way. Probably won\'t last, you know, whatever kind of.. And this spot. It said something about assessment in there.. So the preliminary engineering report said the conditional assessment is beyond the scope of this project. It should be recommended. Well, when the reviewers at the state level reviewed it. They said ah, this preliminary engineering report\'s not complete. It needs a conditional assessment. So only phase one or phase two. Oh man, it\'s just caused a monkey wrench., it wasn\'t perfect. I can\'t go get funding directly with this thing., so what the city\'s doing is we\'re paying to get the conditional assessment done now. Give me everything I need. So I can go in there full bore, and go get this money right now while the infrastructure money\'s pouring down on us. Billion, 2 billion coming to Alaska. Got to grab it., 2 billion to Alaska. So I\'m going to put into the. And then it goes in. We\'re also having the engineer who works for enters information into the. Database. And it has to be in there first anyways, for to be funded, but what the state\'s trying to do is take this windfall of infrastructure, and say all the projects in our huge database of 700-800 projects, all water and sewer, all these water and sewer projects. means ready to go. All the deficiencies are there, everything. These are the high needs. These are Everything\'s ready. fundable projects. So we\'re working real hard to make, fundable. Get rid of that little problem of conditional assessment, get the assessment done, get everything in there get the language, move it up. Right now it\'s, move it up to a. Woo, we want to be funded too. Get that whole thing funded. That would be a huge success. Because people in have been screaming for years coming into Council. ""Look at this brown water! I can\'t believe it, the city\'s giving me brown water."" Well, they don\'t change their filter. You know, there\'s some things they don\'t do. But, it\'s a public display looks bad. We get a lot of complaints. ""Look at this T shirt. This used to be white. How am I supposed to go to work with a T shirt like this. You got to fix the water."" So at least we\'ll show we\'re doing something over there. You know, place some pipes, get some water, it will be more efficient, the water will run a little faster, because we\'re going to ', ""Right, right. There was an ordinance that said, when we come to your neighborhood with a mainline you have to hook up. So it's kind of understood that we are piping the whole town. As fast as we can, as slow as we can. We're trying to pipe the whole town. It's a money saver. And because of we got rid of honey buckets, you know, we're requiring you to hook up to a sewer. Drink our water. We produce safe water. We've got certified people. We've got three wells, running two plants. We're doing everything we can to get you safe water. If you have your own well, or you want to buy water from the city and haul it yourself. Fine. You can do that. Let us know. But it's required that you have hauled services. That you hook up. I mean, your sewer tank has to be 200 gallons bigger than your water tank. A little extra room there. And we're trying to provide you pipe water. So when we come by, hook up. So, we have great cooperation from the. I really thought people were gonna resist just because they didn't want the ugly pipes in their yard. They didn't. We got 100% cooperation. And we'll sign off on easements. Yes, you can come on my property. We got money. I mean, USDA, not just, we're going to bring it to your main line. Hook up to your house. We're gonna hook up to your house. That's a $40,000 cost. You know, each of the. Our grant loan is going to hook up to your house. And then turn it on. And your price goes down. As soon as you're on piped, you start saving money. Unlimited and save money. "", "". Have you had? I mean, we so we went to. And I mean, it was interesting to kind of compare and contrast. And, you know, there's just so much diversity. And, you know, I don't, I don't know that I have the same sense. You know, like I was saying, like, most people here would want pipes. And I think we heard that in as well. But like the amount of trust people have in the water system, the value that they would place or how they prioritize pipe water? I don't have a good sense of that for other communities. like, some of it was what I expected. Some of it wasn't, you know, I mean, and I don't even know, next door, do they feel the same? That sort of thing? And so?, I mean, I guess like, I'm curious about that. If I was in your situation. Water is important. Infrastructure is important. I don't know that I would know what that actually like, specifically, what that means? Does that mean, more water plant operator training? Does that mean more pipes? Or does that mean, more testing of the water? Like the aesthetic issues? That comes up a lot. That seems to be a barrier for people drinking water. Is the smell, look, taste, right? So it's not bad for you to drink water with iron in it, but people sure don't like it, you know? And so if it becomes a factor if people will opt for Coke, or Kool Aid instead, you know, tang instead? So it's, you know?, so I don't know, I was thinking about that. And I don't know if you thought about it at all, or have a better sense of what that would look like. ""]"

They've got, see they've got measures they've got to meet, right? So many of your villages are hitting the score. If they're not, why not? Why aren't you doing your job? Well, because I've got a stack of stuff this big, I gotta go through every quarter of the reports from all my villages. And you don't have time to say hey, how's it going? Ya know, what's new and exciting? It's like, you didn't turn in your financial report to the city council. Ya know, so there's been a lot of trust and respect lost by communities with DCRA because of that which is really sad. Because the Constitution requires that there be a department to assist municipalities, local governments. Of course, it also says the mission of the Department of Corrections is rehabilitation. So, we started to get construction money. w one of the one of the things that in we like doing is forced account So force account is where the village gets to do this.

One guy is the foreman. And everybody else is local on the job. It came out very nice. And these guys, these superintendents, they are you know, they're what you would call in England a builder., this is the guy who comes in before the grounds even clear and tells the dozer operator what to do. And then he lays out where the pilings or the footings are gonna be and supervises and hands on every single step of the way. I mean, they know electric, they know plumbing, they know structural, they know wells and everything. And when I say a long time, I mean a long time ago. So, I don't know if he's still around or not. But these guys, you know, they know how to get along with, with the local crew. They know how to pick talent and how to fire people. Just really, they're squirrely.

You know, I can\'t remember seven to ten percent, on average, something like that. Those are actually good pass rates for a standard class. We\'ve done some things lately working on some different ways to do the teaching, that have got those higher, but they\'re still less than 50%. I think the highest we got was 40%. And everybody in the state thought it was phenomenal. And that took like a crazy amount of hours into that training to get that amount of pass rate. Most people will take this test multiple times before they pass it. We stopped doing level two tests because most people eventually will get their level one, if they stick with it long enough. Most of them will never pass the level two test. We have RMWs that have failed the level two test and not by a lot, by one or 2%, multiple times. They know more about water treatment than I do. They just don\'t test well. And so one of the common things we hear is ""best answer"" questions, or as they call them locally ""trick questions"". There were trick questions on the test. Best answer questions are almost impossible for people that English is their second language, where they don\'t have real solid grasp on English book learning to understand and break down those questions to get the right answer. So then at that point, now they\'re just one in 4, whether they\'re gonna get it right, right, because it\'s multiple choice, and they\'re gonna stab in the dark, because they don\'t, they don\'t get actually what it\'s saying. A lot of these people, if we read them the test questions, they can tell us the correct answer. But if they read it, they struggle to get the correct answer. So it\'s really amazing to see a guy that can answer every question in class, come up short on the test, every time. You\'re like, he\'s going to nail it this time, and but he just doesn\'t quite, when he reads it himself, it doesn\'t sound the same as when I read the question in class. So. ', 'take a test, right?

And I don't know if it's just because the last couple of years, I've dealt with a ton of school complaint issues, but we get a lot of complaints from school teachers that are super unhappy with the quality of water that they get when a lot of times the rest of the community doesn't get that quality or quantity of water.

Yes, that's correct. But they've had the population issue for a few years now. And it's been the big problem is there's some there's some aggressive parasites that are getting into the herd. But, they also. So, so, you get you get ice on, you get an animal that lives on lichens, it'll paw through the snow to get down to the lichens, but they start hitting ice and they're not able to get ice open. So that's the problem that caribou are having. And like I say, up there, muskox up there, in the area, all that rain came down on just literally rotting some of the flesh on their hump. So, he had a real good, real good photo presentation about climate change, and climate change is impacting water and sewer infrastructure in. Right. The ostensible cause everybody's saying is, well, because it rained so hard that the lagoon filled up with too much water, put too much pressure on it, and about a section collapsed. A river that goes up in there, always go needle fishing there, black fish fishing. So, it's got all that effluent there. So, I'm like, Well, you know what, if they're going to rebuild it, they'd better put some thermosiphons in., because who knows, maybe you got a weakness in the permafrost underneath, they haven't done any kind of engineering work to look at that. Like that it's kind of irritating. And then they're gonna build a new lagoon, well, you know, you better do some good geotechnical work here. Don't just, you know, don't just take a hose and we're good, you know, some things that they call money funds. You know, let's, let's spend. They do drill I mean, they do. Find out where that permafrost is, you know, if you got to put a thermosiphon in, put a thermosiphon in. You guys know what thermosiphons are, right? They got them on the. We used to call them VSMs on the pipeline, vertical support members. So, you know, it's going to increase the cost to do it right. But here's the thing. Here's the thing, to do it, right. You're gonna have to spend more money on engineering and design. You're just gonna have to, you're gonna have to do more detailed geotechnical work. It's not just, you know, dig down and have the foreman say,,, that's good. You know, I mean, you gotta you gotta you gotta start getting some stamped reports. And you've got to get a really good outline of, of where the permafrost is, and you've got to start getting better material that that lagoon in was made of pure beach sand. thing mixed into it. We got road gravel one time from. One barge load of tailings million bucks. Delivered.,.. So and I'll tell you this, there's there's another angle, especially in places like. The beach. They started pulling you know, the state doesn't say nothing because so, that's the cost of that's the ecological cost. Ya know. And the cultural cost of getting water and sewer because they used to live in the dunes. Let me show ya. "", ""cost and permafrost, right? Oh,. Let's dig into lagoon let's go down 20 feet from ground level. You know, and they're building Alaska Highway. Talk about permafrost, man they cut and see the problem is once you pop the cover off of permafrost it's like you've shaken up a bottle of pop and then done it., it will not freeze again. So there were a lot of false starts on the Alaska Highway they would start cutting and they would just end up in in cat sinking mud there we better try different route. Out here. They used to have reindeer. And you can still I think see in some places from the air where the reindeer just tore the ground up. Torn up down to the permafrost. And, you know you got buildings that are on pilings. My house heaves. I'm on pilings, you know, permafrost can be bad business. Next time you go to go to the permafrost tunnel. You've heard of that? The Army Corps of Engineers has a permafrost research facility, it's a tunnel. There's really like you go and you see, you know, vegetation and you see, you know, animal remains. It is cool. It is cool. And if you're gonna be thinking about infrastructure of any sort in the north, you gotta think about permafrost. Especially since it's no longer the solid foundation it used to be. There's an anecdotal story that they were building a clinic up in and they were driving piling and it just kept going and going and going and going and going, they kept welding more pieces on going and going and finally somebody said what’s that? Well the piling it hit the ice went like that, and came back up. You know who else to talk to if you haven't, on infrastructure on building conditions is. But you know, go ask her she's got all the time to talk to you about just what challenges has had in, in construction out here. And what challenges they have getting the water, right? What are your challenges in villages where you still don't have good water and sewer into the clinic. They've been fortunate even in places like that’s got a very limited system.

And nobody's on that level playing field yet. So how can we all say that we're equal when we're not all there yet? I remember years ago, going down to conference in. And it was Native leaders from all over the state working for, staff like me, working for nonprofits to come together with what were our legislative priorities, and we're all at tables. And this one lady, this beautiful, Tlingit lady came to our table, and she wanted to interrupt us to ask us if we would present a proposal for her. And this was about building another gathering community center, down in southeastern. So in southeastern Alaska, those were like the first people to become exposed to Western. And they'd have a lot of time to organize and be good be together, they live in a temperate environment that doesn't have the extreme weathers that we have, they have access to resources, the ocean is their table. So she's trying to sell us on taking that into our group and presenting it as a priority to the whole group that we're going to present to legislature and I looked at her I said, you know, my people don't even have flush toilets and running water. I can't, in my right mind, I can't support something like this, a Taj Mahal, down in southeastern when my people don't even have flush toilets and running water. So the state of Alaska too, has got those differences in in the way we're served. So I think it's going to have to be looking at the big picture and what can we do here? Because it's going to be totally different than what we're gonna do there. "", ""had not been a real big community because the riverbank kept eroding. Right. In fact, they were told this might not be the best place to settle. is where they would come. They'd fish, they'd come here and dry their fish. Smoke their fish then go back to where they live in the winter. But people started coming here, you know, guys, married ladies for wives, you know. So we've got some interesting, family compositions here and they came from both directions. Some people came to, they had kind of crossed over the Alaska range prospecting again and some came because there's a lot of there's a lot of sea traffic that came up. So that was hauled water and sewer in. And it has evolved to the system that we have now, the hauled system that we've got, which is still nowhere near perfect. A lot of people wish they could pay by the gallon for their water, the argument would get made. Well, water meters don't work in cold weather. Well they work for a company, right? The water company. My daughter gets water from them., they meter. They meter. So people of course packed water and spilled a honey bucket. After a while the community realized that, well that's a little too willy nilly. So, the city started a water and sewer haul system, and on your day, the sewer guy would come in your house. Pick up your honey bucket, tramp his boots through the living room through the kitchen. Wherever. Spill it in the back of the truck, bring it back and the water truck would come and they would scoop out, you know, five gallons of water, and fill your water bucket. And of course we put huge miles on our vehicles. Get the heck beat out of them and then a few years ago nobody saw this in their bingo card. State weighs and measures came out and oh by the way your water trucks are like 2000 gallons too big for weight load on pavement. So we had to buy smaller water trucks. "", 'So I\'ve lived in Alaska since. But when I lived there, there wasn\'t much a sewer lagoon. And there was a dump. We used honey buckets, packed water from the wellhouse. And, of course chipped ice, you know. But sanitation was you know, pretty poor.. And at one point we had a choice. We could go with a flush haul system that could start getting put together fairly quickly. Or we could wait to get piped water and sewer. And very wise elder, he said. "", forget that."" He didn\'t say that way. He said ""forget that flush haul. We want pipes!"" VSW, and I imagine you guys understand the difference between Village Safe Water (VSW) and IHS. and because you know, as all municipalities, right, has the relationship with VSW. And, you know, back in the old days, would call VSW engineers, probably the most trusted state employees, you know, from community\'s perspective. Because those guys they had to know everything going on the village and know more about village politics than the city administrators. You know, to be able to do their job. Be able to come in and say hey, look, you know, I need you guys to approve this and it was it was really great. They had money, they were able to travel. was our engineer for a long time.. So, we went fly by night for a while. We used VSW to build what we called sanitation roads because everybody hauled their honey buckets by Honda. We got some really horrible roads, we gotta fix these roads. So, they said alright, call them sanitation roads. Tear the beach up, which has been going on for decades. Taking the sand off of it and you know, fix the roads. They actually built. So that put a lot of guys to work. And he came back. And what can we do next? You know, I said, well, you know, we\'re planning on getting a honey bucket lagoon. At one time in there were, oh, man, ponds right in the village that people dumped honey buckets in. I\'ll tell you, on a hot day, You knew what it was. And so, I was, well, let\'s clean these things up, you know. So, we got grant money, hired the guys, got them all Tyvek suits and some nice aluminum rakes. Fabricated because what happened was when. Two things have done more damage to the earth than anything else. Two consumer products. Diapers, which filled landfills. You should have learned that in civil engineering 101. Right? Used to be a landfill was just a big empty hole on the outside of town where people threw their refrigerators and their plastic and their paper, grocery bags full of trash. And then along came Pampers. And all of a sudden, the diaper services. I know all of you, including you, are too young to remember diaper services. ']"

But if they had like a water tank that had flakes in it?

I guess like just learning about fluoride and how people were so against it here was kind of like eye opening to me that one incident at this point must be like years ago, that continues to resonate throughout the communities of how fluoride has a negative impact on human health, rather than the positive impact that it can create. So I can specifically remember just in class, having one of the water plant operators who was very against it. Kind of rolled his e and had to speak out wanted to speak out against fluoride in the class and how it is negative and just having to teach people that within safe measures. And when the state measures aren't removed. Like this, the safeguards are removed, that it can be healthy and it can benefit human health. Especially the health of children that are losing teeth.. So, just trying to convince a class that, you know, this water plant operator was pretty highly respected within the community, his community for sure. But also throughout as one of the more experienced operators that he's worked there for so long. It's kind of has you know, everything's all about what family what name where you're from around here. And when you have like, I'm just some new guy coming in from. I don't know anything. I don't they don't know me. I have no family here. Why would they listen to me? Trying to convince somebody, that's where my struggle was, is I'm teaching them something out of a book, rather than what they have seen with their own e or something that they've been told from, you know, story to story or from elder to elder, so on and so forth when it comes to how stories are exchanged in this area. Being the outsider can be very difficult. "", 'about fluoride. ', ""Kind of like talking about politics., some things have happened over the years, like, especially thinking of fluoride in the past with I believe it was where, you know, you get a pretty bad rep on fluoride and in fluoride in water, and then hears it, and now it's because people have died from it. Fluoride is bad, and fluoride will always probably be bad, unless there's a mass change of mind. t really sure how, how to do that we get I know, along., constant teaching of what fluoride really is, safe levels, and how it benefits the human body and how we have such tooth decay in this area and how it can really improve the health of children. It just doesn't get through to the right people. Or it will not change your minds. It's kind of the same with chlorine. And people think adding more chlorine will be worse for them. Because they can smell like, oh, I can smell it with a little bit. If I put more, I'm just going to smell it more, which is not the case. So with the breaking point, so, I've had water plant operators that have worked for me that I've taught them that, you know, I've explained to them, you need to hit this point, like, this is what you need to do. I've had people in class, argue with me about it, even as I'm teaching them and showing them and like people that they respect, such as their remote maintenance workers are telling them also like, you need to do this for this purpose and to really clean the water.
