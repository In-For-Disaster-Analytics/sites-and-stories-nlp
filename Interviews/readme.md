* [Interviews with Water Sector Stakeholders in Rural Alaska, 2021-2022](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA29Z90D4B)  
Abstract (from Catalog):  
This dataset includes anonymized interview data collected virtually and in-person with stakeholders from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta between November 2021 and August 2022. These interviews were designed to capture water sector stakeholders’ experiences and perceptions of their water infrastructure systems. Interview questions included, for example: “Can you walk us through a typical workday in your role?”; “Who do you interact with most often in your role?”; “What are some of the biggest challenges you face in your role in the water sector?”; and “How do you resolve issues that arise in the water system?” We conducted eight virtual interviews and nine in-person interviews with stakeholders between November 22, 2021 and August 5, 2022. Interviews were recorded (with permission), transcribed, checked for quality, and anonymized for archival.

This dataset includes anonymized interview data collected in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in April 2022. These interviews were designed to capture end-users' perceptions and experiences with their water infrastructure systems. Interview questions included, for example: Can you tell me how you use water in your household?; What do you like about your water or water system?; What are some of the concerns/challenges you deal with in your household water system?; Do you worry about whether your water is safe to drink? Forty-one semi-structured interviews with 55 end-users are included. These interviews were conducted from April 21st to April 29th, 2022. Forty of the interviews were conducted in-person and one was conducted via teleconferencing. Interviews were recorded (with permission), transcribed, checked for quality, and anonymized.
