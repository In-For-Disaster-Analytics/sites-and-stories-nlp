0,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,1,2,Interviewee 1 ,"A sewer project called the [REDACTED], I forget how many 1000 feet. To hook up [REDACTED]. And the  original cost for it was [REDACTED]. So right now what they're quoting us for piped water, hauled, and  sewer is $1 million per 1000 feet. And so we recently, we bumped that [REDACTED] when we originally  started, we bumped it up by 40%. Because of all the all the supply problems and all that stuff that's going  on, we went out to bid this, this happened a month ago. And those projects came in at [REDACTED]. So  funding is the big crux problem. I can say, though, on that, and this is where [REDACTED] will come in.  There's been some big improvements in the systems, you know, like we're using the SCADA system, they  call it and so it electronically monitors the whole. So there's been a lot of improvements in the system  that weren't there before. But the expenses just kill us. It's just. And the problem right now we're in the  mix where the haul drivers, you need CDL licenses to do that. And those are in short supply. And just  today, we're almost down to the point where everybody's going to get water, but they're not going to get  what they need. Or what they want. You better grab a chair [REDACTED], they're doing a water and sewer  study and some of it's on systems. So anyways, from my standpoint, that's kind of been the big challenge.  And another challenge is for us as with the USDA is the paperwork involved. I mean, I can't, I can't, we're  lucky that we have somebody that can process the grants, [REDACTED], we're lucky we got somebody  with a lot of education is what it takes. But like the USDA, it took us two years just to put the application  together. So that's a big challenge for the villages, or anybody else is trying to get through this. And  [REDACTED] was involved in that side of the street in the villages. But so anyways, that's our challenges  of trying to get water, pipe water and sewer. Without it, the town has grown. And it's going to come to a  point where I just said that, we're only going to be able to deliver X amount of water to everybody, and  they'll have to live with it. We don't want to go there. ",00:00
2,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,1,2,Interviewer 1 ,So like with the new subdivisions coming online? ,02:56
1,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,1,2,Interviewee 1 ,"That's what I'm worried about. Yeah, so we're trying to do well, with this project, we're, we're kind of  chasing our tail. Because if this project can come about, it would have saved about [REDACTED] in labor  costs in driving the trucks around. It would also give the current personnel more time to do the work up  town. So there's some other benefits, you know, once you get piped up, we're right in the middle of we  actually did a preliminary engineering report, or we're working on it, it's not complete yet for the whole  town. So that's, so there's a lot of engineering, too, that goes into it just a tremendous amount of  engineering. So the idea that this would be that starting at A whatever you have there would be able to  help deliver water way over here. So the whole system has to get filled up, designed and built sort of  sustained all the way up to [REDACTED]. So that design is in the process, but now the next big hurdle will  be, how in the world are you gonna fund that.  ",02:59
3,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,1,2,Interviewer 1 ,"I think the scope of what we're trying to look at is all those things so just I mean treatment, but also billing  and personnel like you mentioned water truck drivers and like all the steps that go into people not getting  good water at their house is all those pieces. ",04:13
4,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,2,1,Interviewee 1 ,"One challenge on the hauled side of it for us. I mean, it might not be so much for like in a village where  you don't have as many houses. People want different quantities. So you know you'd be delivering 1000  gallons to this house once a week. So we maybe the next house next door wants 2000 gallons a week.  And when you try to meet their needs, their wants. It's not really their needs, but their wants. It's a real  challenge. And you said something about billing. And it's, it's very difficult to bill, I just recently found out  there's like a 10-digit number for all these different. If somebody wants 2000, 1000. So it's a real challenge  over here with personnel. I mean, when you're punching in ten digits at a time, it's really easy to make a  mistake and all that good stuff. So that's, that's been a big challenge, too. So yeah, you need a good  somebody in the billing department that can keep track of this.  ",04:47
9,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,2,1,Interviewer 1 ,I want to back up just a second because we kind of launched in. Can you introduce yourself?  ,05:49
5,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,2,1,Interviewee 1 ,[REDACTED] ,05:56
10,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,2,1,Interviewer 1 ,How long have you been doing this and living here and? ,06:00
6,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,2,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Well I've been living in town about [REDACTED] years and I worked I started working for [REDACTED].  [REDACTED]. And so we've been involved with water and sewer. The other the other big thing I think, too,  that is important is because you're dealing with a lot of land, you got to have utility easements, out here  in Alaska. The property ownership is very nuanced. What is very, can be very contentious. And nobody  knows no, you can't find a recorder in the state of Alaska, you don't have to record anything ",06:04
11,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,2,1,Interviewer 1 ,And the native allotment.  ,06:53
7,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,2,1,Interviewee 1 ,"And you have native allotments. You have just a whole bunch of issues with that. So that's kind of what  was important for us with bringing the general service contractor on board and so that's a company that  can do the engineering, has a real estate division, and it has a bunch of professionals that do different  tasks that they're readily available. Or else we would have never got anywhere with any of this. Especially  in the easements. ",06:54
12,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,2,1,Interviewer 1 ,I remember with [REDACTED] all the easements. One guy says no. ,07:22
8,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,2,1,Interviewee 1 ,"[REDACTED] of them just over there and we did well we got them all, the construction easements. But so  that that was that was another one that you really when you want to talk water and sewer projects, you  don't think of real estate. It certainly does come up. So ",07:31
18,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewer 1 ,"[REDACTED], can you introduce yourself? ",07:49
13,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewee 2 ,[REDACTED] ,07:52
19,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewer 1 ,All right. How long have you been out here? ,07:53
14,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewee 2 ,[REDACTED]. ,07:54
20,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Is that home? [REDACTED]. Well, great. And I kind of introduced ourselves. So all right, I'm gonna kind of  go through some of these questions. But I think you're getting at what we're kind of trying to learn. I guess,  broad question. What are the so, how is water delivery going? Are people getting water? ",08:10
15,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewee 2 ,"They're getting water right now. It's tough right now because we're so shorthanded. I mean, we got  [REDACTED] drivers positions, we only have [REDACTED] filled plus the foreman. So he's driving right now.  And we got [REDACTED] routes a day. So everybody's working [REDACTED] days a week, Saturdays  [REDACTED] routes. So pretty much everybody's working six days a week right now just to keep up.  [REDACTED] and I had a conversation earlier today. You know, we lose a couple of drivers which I'm  hearing a rumor that we might. What are we going to do? The best thing we can come up with is cut  everybody's water back. You know people are getting twice a week, they're gonna get once a week, people  who are getting twice a month they're gonna get once a month. I mean, we're just to that point that we  don't have the personnel. ",08:47
21,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Is that the main, so if somebody doesn't get water at their house is that, that's the first thing you thought  if, was it's drivers that's the main number one thing you would. People on piped water? ",09:35
16,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewee 2 ,Piped water's fine.  ,09:45
22,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewer 1 ,"It's fine? Okay. Okay, yeah. So, I mean, some of this I'm just restating. Because not everyone has lived here  for twenty years. No, that makes sense. And we've heard about the drivers since forever. Is there any?  What are you gonna do? Is there any way?  ",09:46
17,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,3,1,Interviewee 2 ,Anybody got any answers to that? ,10:08
23,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewee 1 ,"So it's a big question nationwide. Yeah, in the trucking industry. I've got a pretty good edition. Something  like that over there about the supply chain issue here, you can take a copy here.  ",10:09
28,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Last I heard was 86,000 drivers needed nationwide. ",10:24
24,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewee 1 ,"And then you know the other thing right at the moment, and we don't, we don't know. How everything’s  gonna end up in the end is like I said, the cost of that water and sewer project quadrupled. And we don't  know what the new norm is going to be. So right now there's that challenge. And we don't know where  it's going to end up. But the water. Finding drivers is a big problem nationwide. So I don't know, maybe  we'll just have to buy the trucks that don't have drivers. ",10:30
30,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Well, I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit, but because it kind of hits on this, though. I mean, so if you had  your choice piped water? ",11:14
25,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewee 1 ,Pipe water is the way to go. ,11:23
29,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah, it's way cheaper. I looked. I think [REDACTED] about the same size as [REDACTED]. I looked at their  utilities. They run about half as much as what our costs are. They're right around [REDACTED] a year in  water and sewer services. ",11:24
31,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewer 1 ,And probably more reliable too. ,11:43
26,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Yeah, it's unlimited water really. ",11:46
32,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, they're not taking. They don't take holidays and. ",11:48
27,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewee 1 ,"The other consequence of the truck too, that you don't think about is the wear and tear on the roads. And  that's especially on gravel roads. And these are big trucks and they're heavy. And so anyway. ",11:52
33,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,4,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Especially when it rains all winter. So looking at some other challenges, we start from where the water is  made. We got [REDACTED] water plants here.  ",12:10
34,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Yeah, that's [REDACTED] domain. ",12:23
41,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewer 1 ,Are there challenges with that? Are we making enough water? Are we gonna be able to make enough  water? Any bottlenecks there? ,12:29
37,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewee 2 ,"No. Right now [REDACTED] running at 45% capacity. [REDACTED] is running at 22% capacity. If and when  the [REDACTED] project goes on, we'll be right around 44% capacity. ",12:34
42,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And the [REDACTED], adding a bunch of houses, right?  ",12:52
38,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewee 2 ,Yeah. Right now it's slated at [REDACTED]. ,12:56
43,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Wow. This is good news, right?  ",13:01
39,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah, it is.  ",13:04
35,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewee 1 ,We were ready to move and we were ready to go to construction this year. ,13:05
44,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewer 1 ,Right I thought this was supposed to be done. I thought I'd be cutting a ribbon here or something. ,13:09
40,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewee 2 ,Well it went from [REDACTED]. That's what the bids came in at.  ,13:12
36,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewee 1 ,"So now we're just have to sit back and wait, see if the world comes to some senses here. But the USDA is  out there looking for trying to find some extra, with upping the grants. And but like I said earlier, that is a  lot of red tape once you get into the government, USDA, EPA, whoever it is it that's a big challenge too.  Took us two years just to get to the application. And so yeah, they got a thing called the letter of  conditions. By the time you're done filling it out, It's about two of those three ring binders. Yeah, so a lot  of work just prepping to get to a point where you can actually go to work. ",13:18
45,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,5,1,Interviewer 1 ,How about water plant operators? ,14:03
48,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewee 2 ,"I'm hurting. Yeah, there's [REDACTED] operators normally for the positions. I only have [REDACTED] right  now and I'm working on hiring an outside firm to come in and help us.  ",14:06
53,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, okay.  ",14:19
49,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewee 2 ,"These guys are working seven days a week right now and they're gonna get burned out. So I talked to a  gentleman in [REDACTED]. He's willing to come out Friday, Saturday, and Sundays. So the guys will get  every other weekend off or at least some break. ",14:22
46,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewee 1 ,"And I think that's a nationwide problem, too. [REDACTED], one of our council members sent me an article  on how Austin, Texas was hurting for water plant operators. And they're boiling their water. ",14:35
58,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewer 2 ,[REDACTED] ,14:48
54,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. The worst we have is [REDACTED]. So what happens then if, you know, you end up down to  [REDACTED] and they get hit. I mean, what if somebody gets hit by a bus? And I mean,  ",14:56
50,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewee 2 ,"I'm going back to a water plant, I guess?  ",15:18
47,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewee 1 ,Set up a cot.  ,15:20
55,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Um, okay. You're kind of the backup plan then? ",15:22
51,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewee 2 ,Yeah just as long as [REDACTED] still around because he's the level [REDACTED]. we have to have a level  [REDACTED].  ,15:26
56,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewer 1 ,"He's been around a long time though, right? I mean,  ",15:32
52,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewee 2 ,[REDACTED] years.  ,15:34
57,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,6,1,Interviewer 1 ,Yeah. So he might not be around forever. ,15:35
59,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewee 1 ,You can't get him out of there. He won't retire.  ,15:37
60,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewee 1 ,[REDACTED] ,15:41
63,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewee 2 ,I asked him.  ,15:41
64,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah, I did the math on his retirement, he would be making [REDACTED]. But Yeah, I mean, it's tough to  figure it out. I mean, I can't do everything. ",15:47
61,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewee 1 ,"The training's offered, that's a good thing. ",16:04
65,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah we got the training. But then we're in a bind right now where we're so shorthanded, I can't even  send anybody to training. You know, I can, but then I'm really hurting myself.  ",16:07
68,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewer 1 ,To where do you send people? ,16:16
71,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewer 2 ,Either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED].  ,16:18
62,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewee 1 ,That's what that rural ,16:20
66,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewee 2 ,"ARWA, Alaska Rural Water Association usually puts one on, NTL puts one on, ",16:21
69,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewer 1 ,[REDACTED] ,16:30
67,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewee 2 ,They only do small treatments here. We have to have a level [REDACTED]. ,16:33
70,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,7,1,Interviewer 1 ,Okay. Because we've heard a lot from other communities about trying to keep an operator and find an  operator and train an operator and get their operator to pass the test instead of just show up for the class  and fail the test over and over again. I've heard a lot about that.  ,16:43
73,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,8,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah the test. From what I understand, it's like a 27% pass rate nationwide, your first time taking it, it is a  tough test. You know, most people with the city that go and take it, the majority of them don't pass it the  first go-around. It's pretty tough. Especially if you're really green and never been in a water plant, and  then here you're going to class, go get your license. And yeah, it's really tough. ",17:00
79,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,8,1,Interviewer 4 ,"So yeah, yeah, I have a couple of follow up questions specifically about kind of operator training. And I  know you said you're certified too so even if you want to think back to some of your experiences as well,  you know, what do you think was more helpful for on the job? Like, is the certification helpful? Or is it  more just kind of a checkbox to be able to do your job? ",17:27
74,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,8,1,Interviewee 2 ,"It's more of a checkbox. I mean, we got pretty simple water plants. I mean, there's sand filters, you just  got to pay attention to chlorine levels, fluoride levels, you know, the biggest two. you know, it's really  hands on. But we're required to have a level [REDACTED] through the state. You know, but we have to  have a level [REDACTED] on staff because we're a level [REDACTED] system. So we always have to have  somebody on staff that is a level [REDACTED] that can respond to either water plant within an hour. ",17:52
77,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,8,1,Interviewer 1 ,And we got one and he's been there [REDACTED] years. ,18:23
75,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,8,1,Interviewee 2 ,"And it's, you know, you got to do 1900 hours just to get your level one, then you got to do another 1900  hours to get your level two. So it's not like you can just go take a test and get it, you still got to do your  time.  ",18:29
72,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,8,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Yeah, it sounds like. I was [REDACTED] for a while, and we had to get Coast Guard licenses and, and they  were having a hard time finding, getting licensed captains. And what they actually did was start in 10th  grade. Start to approach people. So they got practical experience in the summertime. And then when they  graduated there, they can do what he was doing. You take your number of hours in and then you can  move on, but it sounds like the water plant operators are in the same way we need to start down at the  lower level of vocational education. So you know, the older you are, the harder it is to study too. ",18:43
76,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,8,1,Interviewee 2 ,"One position that's open right now is water pipe coordinator. When [REDACTED], it's like okay, I'm gonna  have a hard time filling this. What do I do? So I posted it starting at [REDACTED] a year. And I had one  person interested in it in three years. ",19:24
78,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,8,1,Interviewer 1 ,Wow. What are the requirements for that? ,19:42
81,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,9,1,Interviewee 2 ,"It should be a level [REDACTED] but the one person that showed interest I was considering hiring strongly.  And she didn't even have her level [REDACTED] yet. It was [REDACTED]. Yeah, because I knew she could  keep up with all that paperwork. ",19:46
242,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewee 2 ,"And the trucks you gotta keep them in a secured location, they gotta be in a locked building, you can't sit  outside, you can't park them outside ",1:00:01
249,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewer 2 ,"From a worker and operator perspective, is piped safer for the people doing the work? ",1:00:10
243,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah, a lot safer.  ",1:00:17
246,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewer 1 ,nobody ever crashed a water pipe? ,1:00:20
252,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewee 2 ,I had a water truck hit the water pipe. ,1:00:23
259,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewer 4 ,"And then for water quality, is it another, you mentioned earlier right about the when you're delivering if  the pipes touching the ground or things like that. So you think pipe water is also a lot safer for maintaining  water quality? ",1:00:30
253,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewee 2 ,Yeah. Even the drivers I mean on accident they'll drive away from the water plant with their hatch open  on top. What could get in there? Dropping the hose on the ground and not realizing that they did  anything? You know? ,1:00:44
256,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, as a homeowner too. I mean, having done it both ways, piped waters, like kind of a closed system  and even having had a bird flap up into my overflow, right? ",1:00:58
250,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewee 1 ,Then you have the sewer drivers have got to put up with hepatitis B and all the stuff that comes associated  with that. ,1:01:09
254,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewee 2 ,I think [REDACTED] went around and they did some testing of holding tanks. ,1:01:17
257,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewer 1 ,Looking at chlorine residuals? ,1:01:24
255,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewee 2 ,Yeah and just did some seeing what was in the water in the tanks. I think I'm pretty sure it was her that  headed that up just to see what tanks were doing. And I think she said the tanks come back pretty bad.  ,1:01:25
258,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Well, it's kind of an open question right? like chlorine residual from piped water, you know what it is every  day. They test it at the plant. Right? But if you deliver water to my house, and it sits there for 30 days,  because I only get water once a month. Right? And if I got if it's not covered or dust or algae starts growing,  or whatever falls in there, you know. ",1:01:38
251,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,26,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Yeah like we don't have building codes here. And so you know, plastic tanks are used steel tanks used,  Lord knows what else and with it, you know, you got chlorine in the water, there's going to be a chemical  reaction to Yeah, I used to deliver fuel in [REDACTED] and we had the same problem with fuel tanks, yeah.  Yeah, stuff happens inside the sediment ",1:01:59
264,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewee 2 ,"One house I went to they called me out last week and asked me if I could load their tank for them. They  had white plastic tanks. And I looked in there to figure out what it was I finally got my way up and got in  that tank and they had algae growing in there. And, but they had a window right next to their tank. So all  that light was going into that tank growing all this algae, you know, I told her to mop it up best you can  and chlorinate your tank, and you'll be good. But you get some of these tanks that are aluminum and  steel, you can't see in them. I've looked in a couple of steel ones before. pretty gnarly. ",1:02:29
260,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewee 1 ,"You know, we went through that with fuel tanks too is trying to get when they're manufactured, they  don't usually take in consideration that maybe somebody has to crawl inside them to clean them. And so  just simply at the manufacturing stage if you had a manhole or something on there, so you can do  something but people that's expensive to change a tank out, especially up here so they just leave it and  pretty soon you get a. ",1:03:05
265,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewee 2 ,Then you got the water pump. ,1:03:33
261,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewee 1 ,But you don't have to put up with that with piped water.  ,1:03:34
267,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, yeah, I got we're got a rental over there, dealing with all that stuff. Replace the tank that is old. But  it's I mean, shorty made it to exactly fit in the space that was there. So to cut it to get it out and then to  get the new one and I had to I mean, there's no I would have liked to switch to plastic but I can't find one  to fit well unless I want to go from a big tank to a little tank right in that space. And then the tenants burn  up the pumps and ",1:03:36
262,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewee 1 ,There's just a whole bunch of stuff that goes on with these ,1:04:10
266,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewee 2 ,"One thing [REDACTED] always said it was keep the hauled, they want to build the pipeline. ",1:04:18
268,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewer 1 ,Yeah. What else? ,1:04:26
269,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewer 4 ,"I mean, I guess we've talked about a lot of different kinds of challenges with water infrastructure. Is there  anything we haven't asked you yet or any other stories or challenges you can think of?  ",1:04:32
263,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,27,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Well, another one with hauled here we keep going on hauled is driveways. These trucks are big trucks and  who builds a house that's going to take a semi-truck down the middle of your driveway? We have a lot of  a lot of damage. Insurance comes into play. And right now our code is that we, I think we pay for the first ",1:04:51
270,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,28,1,Interviewee 1 ,"[REDACTED]. So you get a lot of claims, and they start to add up that's coming out of your pocket book,  not the insurance company. And that's, it seems they call every time you start talking about hauled water  and sewer, you always come up with something.  ",1:04:51
275,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,28,1,Interviewer 1 ,How about flooding? ,1:05:35
271,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,28,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Flooding too. Yeah, that's another problem. So that goes maybe to education. And I don't know how quite  to get the word out to everybody. But tanks will overflow. And there are ways to prevent, there's  electronic means. It costs the homeowner probably, we figured $250 to $500 a tank. And the thing is you  got the truck driver outside and he's filling a tank and a lot of times he can't see what's going on inside.  There's overflow pipes on the tanks. But a lot of times the water's coming in faster than the overflow can  handle. So out the top it comes and the guy standing out there pumping away and pretty soon, your house  is full of water. And that has happened quite a bit. And it's like I was saying I was in the fuel business. And  normally, we would not fill a tank unless somebody was physically watching the tank. So it took two people  but it's not realistic to drive two people. So that has been an ongoing, big issue. And part of part of the  cost too to the insurance company will just keep paying and paying out which runs your premium up. So  we kind of got a handle on that one in the last four or five years. But that is a problem with it. And that  this stuff starts with the homeowner when he's building another house knowing that you know that he  needs to have an overflow gauge on his on his tank. And we don't have a building code here. And that was  probably where that would play in if we did. ",1:05:36
276,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,28,1,Interviewer 1 ,And sometimes they freeze too. I mean I've had that happen. ,1:07:21
272,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,28,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Right so the overflows will freeze, so that's another issue and we go up and they bang on them. And but  yeah, so that's, that is another problem in the wintertime. So we're full of freezing, nothing cut because  that's how they tell if that if it's overflowed on the outside, if it starts coming if water starts coming out of  the overflow, then they know to shut it. They could discharge water from the truck. But that's where the  alarm comes in. And they need some way to ",1:07:24
277,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,28,1,Interviewer 1 ,"it seems like that speaks to the importance of good employees too though right? So if you got a delivery  guy who's paying attention and is experienced, and he knows he's listening and watching versus, ",1:07:59
273,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,28,1,Interviewee 1 ,"but a lot of times it'll come from, if the overflow pipe isn't big enough to handle the discharge, we're  pumping it you know, 100 gallons a minute. And so even by the time it's come out of that discharge pipe,  it's already overflowing ",1:08:13
274,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,28,1,Interviewee 2 ,They were pumping 100 gallons. I slowed them down so we don't have that issue.  ,1:08:30
285,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewer 1 ,"That's funny, we watched a pump guy fill up today and I was like, oh, that must have been a really thirsty  house because it seemed like it was taking some time.  ",1:08:37
281,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewee 2 ,I backed them down to 80 gallons/minute. ,1:08:44
278,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewee 1 ,"I mean, I think that's a consideration too is that when you know if you're starting from scratch you know  I'm gonna go deliver use trucks to deliver water is I don't think there's enough effort put it how much time  does it take to do each one of these? Then by the time you add it up and go, well, I was surprised you  know, so you know that the 1000 gallons gonna sit there for 20 minutes to a half an hour. ",1:08:48
282,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewee 2 ,And it takes us 20 minutes to fill the truck.  ,1:09:13
279,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewee 1 ,"So there goes just labor costs and all that. Those aren't things you really think about I guess. We should  be thinking about it. Don't always get thought about when you say okay, we're gonna deliver water by  truck. ",1:09:18
286,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewer 1 ,What do you think's gonna happen with the [REDACTED]? Just waiting on money? ,1:09:32
280,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewee 1 ,"So the bids came in in [REDACTED] and we had 60 days for it to before we can back out or just say it's too  much Yeah, so we're just gonna let things cool down and go out to bid again. ",1:09:51
287,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewer 1 ,"you think it's, you think prices are gonna come down? ",1:10:05
283,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Well I mean, it's crazy like, like our pumps, they just went up $300 a piece in two weeks. ",1:10:08
288,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewer 1 ,Lumbers kind of peak and come back down right? ,1:10:27
284,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,29,1,Interviewee 2 ,"It's a little bit it's not back to where it was, you know a lot of other things are just astronomical trying to  find something. And the lead time, right. I mean, I lost the waterline I had to lay the new line in the dead  of winter on top of the guy's driveway. So I told him I said, well I'll come back this spring. springs here and  I can't even get the materials ",1:10:30

300,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,30,1,Interviewer 4 ,"Yeah, well, one question that we've been asking too, is kind of, if you could wave a magic wand and fix  one thing, what would you do?  ",1:11:24
295,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,30,1,Interviewee 2 ,Pipe the whole town.  ,1:11:33

298,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,30,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Anecdotally, you know, when I've talked to guys at public works, you know, talking to the drivers versus  talking to the, you know, the guys that spend their time on the pipe water system, you know, just how  much they like that so much better. It's like, it's great. You just drive around in the truck. And then if the  lights on you stop. And if it's not, you don't stop ",1:11:42
291,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,30,1,Interviewee 1 ,And that's too with the SCADA system. So they probably won't have to drive around. ,1:12:00
296,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,30,1,Interviewee 2 ,Well they still need to go to every house to see if a red lights on.  ,1:12:05
292,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,30,1,Interviewee 1 ,"I know. But I mean, if you get your new system going, you should be notified if those lights go on, right? ",1:12:08
297,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,30,1,Interviewee 2 ,Not at all the houses. That's a lot of money to do that. All our maintenance stations will have that.  ,1:12:13

299,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,30,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, I got a system for that as I get a text when my neighbors walk by and tell me when the light on my  house is on. You got a little thing going on. I do that for the [REDACTED] who live next door and they do it  for me.  ",1:12:24
294,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,30,1,Interviewee 1 ,Do you got a connection with [REDACTED]? ,1:12:39

301,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,31,1,Interviewee 1 ,I kind of want to get a hold of one of them. ,1:12:49

308,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,31,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, about lead times too I was talking to with [REDACTED] about this [REDACTED] building stuff. I had a  meeting with her and the [REDACTED] about playgrounds. It's like, oh, well, you know, you guys got like  [REDACTED] months left on this grant. It's like, we got a barge season we already missed. So it's like, yeah,  if we could get this, then we'd still have to, like [REDACTED] months is nothing like it's gone. Like we need  to pay for it now. We're not going to be done in a year. What are you talking about? ",1:13:10
304,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,31,1,Interviewee 2 ,"It's tough, stressful, like you said the barge season and [REDACTED] just looked at playground equipment.  They stuff they have in stock they can't promise it to us for 22 weeks. Even the stuff they have in stock. ",1:13:39
303,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,31,1,Interviewee 1 ,And that's why they were why we went out when we went out to bid and the two bidders are there in a  room. And that was their biggest problem. They just they cannot get anybody to give us any lead times.  So they're taking a wild guess. And the end result was a crazy quadruple bid. ,1:13:52
305,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,31,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah, all the prices they're getting from vendors, they were gonna give them three days. That's all the  price was good for. ",1:14:11

311,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,31,1,Interviewer 4 ,This was a two-year project. Yeah.  ,1:14:21
310,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,31,1,Interviewer 3 ,"Is there any training you wished you had? In order to do what you do normally, that you don't currently  have? Do you feel like you've got all the resources that you need to do what you do? ",1:14:26

It's, I mean, there's still complaints in town here about the fact  that they come from another part of town and they drag whatever baggage they drag. But it's worked,  we haven't got sued. So that's ",1:15:26

319,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,32,1,Interviewee 2 ,"I penciled it out, tried to see if I could make something like that work. Like two weeks on two weeks off.  The problem with the guys that are two weeks on two weeks off, they all want to work seven days a week,  12-hour days. So that means I have to have a mechanic on that period of time. And overtime. Then I need  streets and road guys out all the time to keep the roads open the whole time they're running. It just turned  into this big fiasco, where either I'm going to have a lot of people working a lot of overtime, or I'm going  to have to hire more people and have more positions. ",1:15:43
314,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,32,1,Interviewee 1 ,Which means the revenues have got to cover all that too ,1:16:20
320,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,32,1,Interviewee 2 ,"[REDACTED], you know they function 24/7 anyhow. So it's easy for something like that. ",1:16:26
86,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,9,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, no, I don't I don't think, yeah, she was kind of a low point with all that COVID work, I think? Well,  we're still hoping to bring her on board, aren't we? ",20:02

87,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,9,1,Interviewer 1 ,"You never know. Could have a bad day at work? So yeah, just I guess, to kind of reiterate that, you know,  there's training, the state used to have kind of its own certification, and then we went to the national  standard, so that, you know, the operator training is the test is what everybody takes, anyway. And is that,  do you think that's a good thing? I mean, is there stuff in that class that in that certification, that's, that's  valuable?  ",20:17
83,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,9,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yes, definitely.  ",20:54
88,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,9,1,Interviewer 1 ,"versus, you know, like, on the job training, versus some combination of the two, like, what would you? If  it was up to you, what would you, how would you set it up? ",20:55
84,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,9,1,Interviewee 2 ,"If it was up to me, how I would set it up is you get tested on the plant that you're running. I mean, because  you go in and take this class and you take a test you're learning membrane filters, you're learning reverse  osmosis, learning. You know, five, six different ways to treat water. And if you're gonna stay in one area ",21:07
89,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,9,1,Interviewer 1 ,A bunch of stuff we don't have here. ,21:28
85,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,9,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah, I mean, learn the system that you're going to be doing. Get tested on what you're going to be doing.  You know, before I got into the water business, I never thought about water killing people. I never thought  about it, I mean it never crossed my mind you know, just going, get thrown in the water plant and  operating a water plant not knowing how bad you could hurt somebody with water. That is a very  important part. ",21:30
80,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,9,1,Interviewee 1 ,It's happened out here too. I mean a lot of sick people in [REDACTED]. ,21:54
90,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,10,1,Interviewee 2 ,"You know, I don't know if you remember I had [REDACTED] come up and you know, kind of give like an  hour class to the water truck drivers, because they had no clue on pathogens. Just give like an hour course  and explained to them. You know, dropping that hose on the ground isn't a good thing. ",21:57

98,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,10,1,Interviewer 4 ,"Well, yeah, I'm wondering, so a little bit more about operations training again. So say you hire someone  brand new? What are the steps going forward? So maybe someone who doesn't have a certification?  What would you do kind of first step, second, third, ",22:43
91,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,10,1,Interviewee 2 ,"We get them in the water plant. The guys that are in the water plant train them. Get them to understand  the system, how the system works. ",22:57
99,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,10,1,Interviewer 4 ,"And is that by like showing? Right, like kind of more hands on, right? ",23:06
92,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,10,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yes. Then after that, we start looking for a class to send them to. Usually the classes maybe every four to  six months, you can find a class to send them to. So we immediately start looking for a class to get them  into. And they get certified. You know but they only get their provisional until they get their 1900 hours  and then get the level one. ",23:10
96,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,10,1,Interviewer 1 ,What do you do if they take a test and they don't pass? ,23:35
93,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,10,1,Interviewee 2 ,"I just had a guy do that. Just, next class that comes up, send them to it. And I got lucky and there was one  I found within six weeks. He just took it and we usually don't find out results for about four weeks. ",23:40
97,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,10,1,Interviewer 2 ,Are they able to work in the meantime? like to be certified? Exactly how? What does that? Does it limit  their ability to work or does it limit more of like the plant as a whole? ,23:53
94,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,10,1,Interviewee 2 ,"No, this was I got the level [REDACTED] on hand and he's within an hour. He can go in there and start  running the plant just as long as he can, if there's something going wrong, call [REDACTED]. And  [REDACTED] would go over there. We're legally allowed to do that. Because I asked the same thing a long  time ago. Okay, how am I gonna keep this running if I don't have operators? But if he does leave, I don't  know what I'm going to do. ",24:05
100,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,11,1,Interviewee 1 ,"We did, what we fell back on, he was able to find two people that would fly in. That'll break anybody's  budget. ",24:36
109,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,11,1,Interviewer 1 ,Right. Yeah. Can you get on a plane right now? ,24:45
104,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,11,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Well, one company I talked to, when I first started talking to him. He wanted to be out here seven days a  week. And it was going to be 7500 bucks a week. So then I talked to him in just coming on Friday, Saturday,  and Sunday. So I got it down to 4200 bucks a week. ",24:47
111,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,11,1,Interviewer 3 ,"And it sounds like most of the people that you have coming in aren't already certified unless you're  specifically flying them in to help fill gaps. Is that, are usually training people on the job? ",25:06

103,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,11,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Right now. We're not taking extra calls. We're not doing anything extra right now. That's a, that's a big  chore for our staff. It definitely is. The other one is call outs. So normally, we think of those people that ",26:02
113,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,12,1,Interviewee 1 ,"might be missed, or, you know, they phone up and complain, I didn't get their water. But even there's a  lot of people that want extra water, meaning that they don't have enough, their order 1000 A week  doesn't quite squeal them through for whatever it is ",26:02

114,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,12,1,Interviewee 1 ,"And it's two pieces to that too, you gotta remember, there's sewage.  ",26:31
118,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,12,1,Interviewee 2 ,"It was bad at the beginning, you know, when something new to the public, you know, of course, people  are going to complain a little bit. I mean we don't have the manpower to do it. ",26:39
115,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,12,1,Interviewee 1 ,"It does take up staff time too. So it goes to kind of like along with the billing, we've got a billing person  basically got one person sitting there dealing with customers, they phone. That phone, it doesn't stop. ",26:51
119,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,12,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah it's not just one guy jumping in a truck and going and giving them some extra water. It's every, like  you said finances involved and billing's involved. Then the foreman has got to get involved to keep track  of all this. So the public just thinks okay, I can get 200 gallons, what's the big deal? There's a lot more to  it.  ",27:05
116,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,12,1,Interviewee 1 ,"That is one thing that you know, that we've tried to encourage them, I guess I think that [REDACTED] says  they have to have 1000 gallon water tank. So we've tried to encourage people to take more when we  come but then you have to pay for it. Not everybody can pay for it. So that's why I think you get, you know  especially if you're on a fixed income. Even though you might get, it might be more expensive to get water  eight times a month, the bill is still enough to your paycheck can cover it, cover the amount even though  in the end, it's more you know, but you can pay for it. Fuel's delivered around here the same way where  they'll deliver as little as 40 gallons, and you go why would anybody order 40? Well that's what their  paycheck can sustain. If you're living paycheck to paycheck. So that's, that's another reason why we see a  lot of phone calls, too I think. And our water is not cheap. It's really expensive. What, I don't know, what  am I paying? I'm paying I think [REDACTED] a month for water and sewer for [REDACTED] gallons. And  that includes. I'm not even sure if that's accurate, but I think it is because I got it on Express Bill Pay and  just received the bill. ",27:26
121,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,12,1,Interviewer 1 ,I know and it goes up [REDACTED] every year. Right? ,28:49
117,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,12,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Right, we're probably going to kill that. Not only do the revenues have to cover the day-to-day expenses,  you know, in council when [REDACTED] was on it, they set aside some funds for depreciation and that's a ",28:51
122,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 1 ,"real weak spot in municipalities. setting funds apart for depreciation. And if you are setting funds aside  for when the day comes that you need it, that they're there. Because they tend to kind of slide sideways  into something else. But it's really important. I mean, like right now, you know, we'd never do this thing  at [REDACTED] but you know, 20 years ago, maybe if we'd started on the depreciation, as a guess, it would  have been a kitty bank for that. But I've got the number here which it should be. Anyways, that's another  big part of the puzzle eventually down the road if you start with a system or any system is being able to,  M&O costs. It's just not thought of enough. ",28:51
126,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 2 ,Yeah our hauled water is [REDACTED] per 1000 gallons per mile. ,30:04
133,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewer 3 ,That's the cost to you. ,30:13
127,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah, that's what it costs the city.  ",30:15
132,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So you guys have both been doing this a while. Over time, like, are we getting better at this? Is the water  delivery situation? Or the water? I mean, delivery and piped is are we in a better spot than we have been? ",30:18
128,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 2 ,"I think with all the new trucks and everything, but now I got all these brand new trucks and no drivers. ",30:32
123,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 1 ,"So yeah, it's, I'd say a little bit, you know, like he says, we got the new trucks, so we're not paying as much  in maintenance on the trucks anymore.  ",30:38
124,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Yeah, right, downtime. So definitely keeping the equipment up to speed is a big. If you're doing trucks  anyway. Well any of it, but trucks especially because they wear out faster than the pipe does. That's the  other reason for pipe too is. what's the lifespan of a piece of pipe? ",30:48
129,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 2 ,downtime.  ,30:48
130,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 2 ,Well the new pipe's 50 years. The HDPE. The older pipe is 25 to 30. ,31:08
125,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 1 ,And the trucks are getting. the trucks are every five years or so. That's our goal is every five. ,31:14
131,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,13,1,Interviewee 2 ,We change them out every five years. ,31:20
140,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Assuming every, Yeah, it doesn't get rolled over or wrapped up ",31:22
134,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Right. They're costing us what two to three, almost 300 ",31:25
138,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewee 2 ,"240 to 260, depending on water or sewer. ",31:30
135,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewee 1 ,"And that's, that's, we're able to get that price because we're piggybacking on the state of Alaska's  Procurement Code. So if you're, if you're me or you going out and buying it, you'd probably add another  40 or 50 to that cost. ",31:34
141,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So thinking about progress. I mean, so we got the new trucks. Probably the biggest thing before that is  institutional corridor. And then what, [REDACTED] pipes? We haven't really, is that it? ",31:52
139,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Well, we've redone the backbone on the sewer all the way up the highway. Got a new lift station, we did  that. And that was done all the way down to [REDACTED]. All the way to the main lift station all the way  out to the lagoons. that was all done ",32:04
142,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewer 1 ,We took a drive out to the lagoons. ,32:17
136,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Now, there is some progress coming, we hope it was these crazy prices. Anyways, of course, to get the  [REDACTED], we were going to talk about the [REDACTED] too. we've we're pretty close to kind of  proceeding moving on to try to fix that up there and add [REDACTED] new houses up in that direction,  too. So the prices are I don't know what we're going to do. Like I said, we're just gonna be calm for  [REDACTED] months. ",32:18
143,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Looking at the [REDACTED], as an example, though, because that's relatively recent. Can you describe how  that changed? How that was progress, or, you know, how that changed things? ",32:48
137,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,14,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Well one thing is it brought in revenues, other than, it brought in commercial revenues. And so it was,  that was a big shot in the arm to the fund itself. You know, and that's another thing is like we're plumbing.  A lot of these grants like this grant here, it's a grant loan is what it is with USDA with the [REDACTED]  project, so we only can hook up houses with that grant, but there are commercial entities in the area. And  those are really important to generate the revenue that you need for depreciation and all the other good ",32:59
144,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,15,1,Interviewee 1 ,"stuff that you know, that we've been talking about, you know, the homeowner just can't really cover it so  I mean, like the water bill, I mean, like [REDACTED], you know, with the water they use over there is huge.  So, yeah, you know, like I said, a lot of times people go out and do want to plumb a neighborhood, thinking  they can help but they also need to be thinking about some of the commercial entities in the  neighborhood too trying to get them hooked up. Because it's, it's kind of a face to tail thing. You know,  you spend all this money here, you need something coming in. To get to the next step. ",32:59
150,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,15,1,Interviewer 1 ,The commercial entities pay a different rate. That's the deal. ,34:13
145,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,15,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Right. And they use a lot of water. Yeah, that's, that's really what the kicker is. And it's metered. That's  the other thing is our water trucks don't meter. The meter is going and they're using a timer. Anyway So  then you've got some accurate numbers to the meter where you don't really. one of the issues up in Alaska  anyways, is meters in the wintertime tended to freeze up. But we were able to find, we were able to find  a meter that will do and we had we had them installed in the new trucks. So that was the other thing, if  you do truck is that they actually work with the manufacturer to spec your truck out for your needs. That's  why we got the meters where before we didn't, and, and whatever else, we listened to the [REDACTED]  heavy equipment operators about how the truck was actually made, you know, this, this will hold up here.  And the trucks we were getting off the shelf were falling apart. So that was if you do truck, that was an  important part about it too. ",34:18
147,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,15,1,Interviewee 2 ,"We got [REDACTED] and the trucks involved, the pumps and all that we went down and spec'd it all up.  So it fit what we thought was best for us. So now you got some efficiencies there and the pipe is still you  just can't beat it other than how much it costs to get it up and get it installed. That's the catch 22 ",35:30
151,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,15,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I was gonna ask about that next, because we've got [REDACTED] pipe systems. One of them is old, right  past, its 25 years or whatever. ",35:49
148,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,15,1,Interviewee 2 ,I think it was done somewhere between [REDACTED]. ,36:01
152,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,15,1,Interviewer 1 ,So it's past way past.  ,36:06
146,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,15,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Another one, that council wrestled with a lot too is. And we're still wrestling with is who's responsible for  what once you install the system in the house. And right now the lift stations are really, the list stations, I  think for the [REDACTED] are around [REDACTED] for the houses? ",36:08
149,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,15,1,Interviewee 2 ,"When it was put in, it was around [REDACTED].  ",36:30
153,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,16,1,Interviewee 1 ,"[REDACTED] And those are quoted at [REDACTED] right now. But what I'm getting at is those are big pieces  of concrete. And right, they belong to the homeowner. And so it's like when you buy a house, and you  know you check out your roof, you check out your foundation, but most people don't check out their lift  station. Yeah. So right now we've got about [REDACTED] over there sitting sideways and every which way  because of the permafrost, and you know, all of a sudden the homeowner, we're telling the homeowner,  hey, that's your responsibility. I would much rather have that discussion up front. Yeah if that's a  [REDACTED] project, a lot of homeowners aren't going to be able to. So you know, I explored it. I've been  kind of exploring the insurance side on that, you know, I don't know, the reply I got from the insurance  company was most, most systems would be insured by the homeowner, other than if it wasn't, because  of freezing up. So the insurance company won't pay for something that's froze up and damaged. But they  might pay for. But it's just something that needs to be thought of going into it. How homeowners are  going to deal with this. I mean, even like if it's a million dollars for 1000 fee, and you know, you got 50 feet  of this, it is still really expensive for the homeowner. And then you got you gotta look out and see if there's  somebody in the neighborhood which we have a problem here in [REDACTED]. You know, if somebody's  houses, they can't do the pipes. Go south, going to the mainline. Who in [REDACTED] can go over there  and fix it? you know, and that's, that's a problem. Plumbing. plumbers. So that's, that's a big. I mean, it's  great if you can get water in the house, if it can't be maintained, and the city's not responsible for it. And  the homeowner doesn't have the money. You're sitting there kind of backed up. ",36:31
157,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,16,1,Interviewer 1 ,"No, I know, as a homeowner too, like that's right. Mine might have been one of the ones. But, you know,  just even if money wasn't an issue, finding someone to do it, right? so as grinder pumps burn up, like do  you want me going on Amazon to try to buy a new grinder pump?  ",38:32
155,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,16,1,Interviewee 2 ,"That's why we, the city took over the grinder pumps.  ",38:53
158,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,16,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. I mean, so if mine backs up, that might affect other people too.  ",38:55
154,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,16,1,Interviewee 1 ,"So like the lift stations the problem was is usually the way it goes is you know, anything in between the  mainline and the house is the homeowners responsibility. I mean, that's the way the codes kind of written  for us. And that's the way most utilities are. Your electricity and everything else. But I would think that if  I would have to do like [REDACTED] over, and knew what I knew now. I think we would have done it a  little bit different. I don't know maybe we wouldn't, but I just think it's a it's a big burden on the  homeowner. However it gets resolved. It just needs to be at least thought of going into these projects. ",39:01
156,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,16,1,Interviewee 2 ,"We did the [REDACTED] a little different. Yeah, we didn't get as elaborate as some people would like to  see you know, a lot of, couple people want to see us put pilings in and to put the lift station on pilings. But  the cost just gets too crazy.  ",39:43
159,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,17,1,Interviewee 1 ,And at least up in this neck of the woods. A lot of these problems are because of the permafrost and  climate change and thaw and all that stuff.  ,39:56
163,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,17,1,Interviewer 1 ,Talk about that. That's on the list. ,40:05
160,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,17,1,Interviewee 1 ,"we're definitely seeing the results. We, you know, other than that the [REDACTED] been installed for 20  years. So there's going to be wear and tear but the lift stations over there are definitely sinking into the  tundra. I mean, there's some of them are, some of them are actually pulling the pipes apart. And I know  up in, [REDACTED]. Yeah. So they are really having this problem up in the slope, where they, especially  some places have actually tried to bury the huge utility corridors in some places where they've tried to  bury the pipe, it's actually separating from the houses. So the houses are sinking, the pipe is going this  way. And it's just and we don't, we don't know what the future, what we see now it's only going to get  worse. And yeah, this permafrost. Just thawing with the permafrost. The other thing is to understand, you  know, permafrost, I'm no expert, but the [REDACTED] up there, the army and all them did quite a bit of  research on it. But there's different types of permafrost too, you know, you could have a frost ball  underneath it. And that's different than maybe some sand underneath the permafrost. So that's a  challenge too, because you really don't know what you're getting into. Boreholes and soil samples before  you build something, I guess is the answer. But that's a challenge too. Yeah, we permafrost, it we see it in  the roads, we see it in the foundations in the houses you see in the piped water? You see it just about  everywhere. ",40:07
164,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,17,1,Interviewer 1 ,Do you think that it has affected water quality? are we pulling different water? ,41:55
161,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,17,1,Interviewee 2 ,No our water has been the same. And we're actually getting ready to do another test at [REDACTED]. ,42:01
165,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,17,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Are there seasonal changes in the water, like more tannins, or whatever I've heard? ",42:08
162,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,17,1,Interviewee 2 ,"We don't see it so much. Because how far our groundwater travels. But our groundwater is traveling from  the mountains, going into the ground at the mountains before it even gets here. So there's a lot of  purification from the ground itself, before it even gets to us. So our waters been pretty much stable. But  like I said, the [REDACTED], we got something going on over there that we're still trying to figure out. The  disinfection byproducts from the chlorine. Those levels have been high. And talking with the engineer,  he's saying that they're seeing this all over the country right now, for whatever reason, and they're not  sure why. So we're getting more samples from [REDACTED] trying to figure out how to fix the problem. ",42:13
171,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,18,1,Interviewer 1 ,"That was the thing up at the posting, it's this is not an emergency. We saw that. ",43:01
170,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,18,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah, you know. And the other part of that testing, too, is it's a quarterly test. And it's averaged out  between the quarters. And if you miss one, you're always gonna be high. You know and unfortunately, we  missed one every so often because of the turnover that we have. So if you missed that one in a year, your  everything's high. But our last go around, we did get all four quarters, and it is dropping. ",43:07
166,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,18,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Definitely what's in the dirt though can make an effect. We've got really high levels of natural [REDACTED]  in this area. It's all the studies show that, the only study I know was in Florida, and they put a bunch of  [REDACTED] in this dirt and let them run around for a few years and they came up nothing happened to  them. But if you say [REDACTED], people just go nuts, you know? Yeah. So some of this, like when he turns  this one of these flyers, this notice goes out to everybody, you know, we get a lot of people gotta boil  water, you gotta boil water. No, you don't. So that can be a challenge, too. ",43:39
174,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,18,1,Interviewer 4 ,"Can you expand a little bit more on that? Kind of talking about, you know, how is communicating with the  public about water? maybe and kind of, ",44:26
167,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,18,1,Interviewee 1 ,"We're kind of well, you know, you've got a we just recently hired a media firm to kind of, I think the biggest  thing is just being transparent. And the trouble is, most people phone up, they're hot, they're mad. ",44:33
172,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,18,1,Interviewer 3 ,"Yeah, they're not calling with compliments, right? ",44:52
168,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,18,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Or if they can't get what they want, they get mad. So it definitely does need, you know, some skill and  personal, you know, media, it really is important. And we've been trying to improve it for the last year or  two or three, maybe years, something like that. And trying to let them know, you know what our problems  are. So, you know, people just don't, they don't really think of water and sewer until they have a problem  with it. You know, it's something is so natural. It's just something that's supposed to occur every day  without problems, but. So it's kind of just getting the information out there and letting them know it. And  we've been actually right now, we're, we release a thing every morning, and telling people what routes  are going to be delayed and so forth. So at least, they can kind of know. ",44:56
173,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,18,1,Interviewer 3 ,And that's just like a mailing list? ,45:51
169,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,18,1,Interviewee 1 ,[REDACTED] put it on Facebook. ,45:54
183,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Are people responsive to that? I mean, does that help be in?  ",45:57
178,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewee 2 ,It helps.  ,46:00
184,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewer 1 ,So they know. ,46:01
179,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewee 2 ,"I mean, I mean, everybody looks at Facebook, but me I guess. ",46:02
175,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Yeah, I think it does. ",46:10
180,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewee 2 ,"But like you mentioned even that letter we send out people don't read it. They just see it, the panic mode  sets in. You know, I think we even got bold letters in there saying this is not an emergency. ",46:11
185,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Well, that's I mean, it's nuanced stuff, you know, I had to read it three times, it's like, oh, this is a violation.  It's a contaminant. Don't worry about it. We're required to send you this notice. But it's fine. Is it? I don't  know. ",46:22
181,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewee 2 ,But we got to use their form.  ,46:38
176,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Sounds like one of those commercials you see from selling medicine or something. We've learned to, I  think it's very important to have some kind of way to communicate with the public. ",46:39
186,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, for sure. ",46:39
182,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Like that [REDACTED] hit, that was a nightmare. ",47:01
177,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,19,1,Interviewee 1 ,"It also helps sometimes with the billing because, you know, trying to explain. We're doing our rated sewer  study right now to try to. But right now, if somebody came into the door and say, How come it cost me  [REDACTED] for 1000 gallons of water? I couldn't really give them a straight answer. So that's nice to have.  [REDACTED] can give you good stuff on how much it costs us to make these. we've got that. ",47:04
191,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,20,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I remember, we had the big one. And that's kind of where that rate structure came out with the  [REDACTED] zones. ",47:37
187,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,20,1,Interviewee 1 ,"And then they merged zone two and three together. And that's the problem kind of now. And so we're  trying to get it down. Most places go, they set their rates, they cost so much per mile to deliver. And that's  what we went a different route. So right now we're trying to go back to the how much it cost per mile. I  think that's what we'll see when we're done. Not that we'll use it, but at least we'll have it. ",47:44
192,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,20,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So as for, for an individual how far it goes? Or for the average? ",48:13
188,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,20,1,Interviewee 1 ,Individual ,48:18
193,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,20,1,Interviewer 1 ,So like if I like I pay more than my neighbor? ,48:19
189,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,20,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Oh, no, it won't be that but at least we'll understand. Understand it. Yeah. When they started, when we  started the study and they started asking the questions, we started to go nuts, because that's exactly what  they were doing and how far it was from this guy's house to that guy’s house. They were really breaking  it down. But at least we'll kind of have it. The concern really are the ones that are really far away. ",48:23
194,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,20,1,Interviewer 1 ,"[REDACTED], right? ",48:48
190,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,20,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Right. You know, when we merged the two together so, because if we had done it the original way, the  people furthest away, the bill would have been so big that they couldn't have paid. So we just said, okay,  we'll blend it in, you know, over here like this. So with the other zone two, so two and three are kind of  together. So we're at right now we just kind of want to see what it will cost to get out there. And it's  important to get it kind of noted down or squared away, because it goes in if you start installing your pipe  system, you kind of want to know what the costs are going to be and if what they're paying is going to  cover those costs, you know, so there's kind of some stuff that gets married up into decision making that  you need to know. right now we're just really weak on we really don't know how much we're paying to  get to [REDACTED] anymore. ",48:49
195,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,20,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Well, right. And, I mean, I know what bothered me is if they're not paying more, they keep building houses  out there. Yeah. I wanted to build that into the price of the house, you know, so that they don't get  shocked. ",49:44
196,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,21,1,Interviewee 1 ,"I probably won't be here when it happens. But right now we've got one subdivision that I think it's  [REDACTED] houses, we've got, probably at least I don't know how many subdivisions but probably at  least [REDACTED] new houses that could be built. And so the added onto the truck drivers is gonna be a  lot. I always worried, you know, I'm kind of still maybe in, but like I said, I probably won't be here, if they  get too spread out with too many houses that might come to what we're coming to today where we can  only say that we only can deliver X amount for everybody to get the water. ",49:59
202,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,21,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, it would be like the garbage truck or something. Wednesday's your day because you live in this  neighborhood. So probably not as big issue here as some of the other communities. Are the people that  opt not to use city water? Is traditional usage? Rainwater collection? ",50:34
197,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,21,1,Interviewee 1 ,"We do offer a well at one of the water plants. And there's a well over there that they can come in and  pay, what, I don't know what they're paying. ",50:36

199,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,21,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Ones, fives and 10s. But that's kind of a, you know, if, for whatever reason, maybe a water pipe broke  down over here, or mainline or something, you know, at least having water available in the community.  Like a well, and most villages have them too is it's a real plus to install.  ",51:19
205,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,21,1,Interviewer 1 ,But they're supposed to be right? ,51:54
201,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,21,1,Interviewee 2 ,Everybody's supposed to be connected to water and sewer services. ,52:03
217,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewer 3 ,What are they using if they're not on your water? Rainwater and river? ,52:05
207,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewee 1 ,Who knows. ,52:08
211,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Rainwater and honey buckets. They don't connect to the sewer. And, you know, we try to police it the  best we can. We usually don't hear about it til the neighbors complain. ",52:08
208,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewee 1 ,"I think maybe, you know, down the road. I mean, Alaska's always kind of slow and getting into the mix on  some of this, but some of the alternate ways that are out there, too. So you're actually making water at  home, you know, I mean, I was just seeing something the other night where there's a unit that they put  on a roof, and he's making water you can get so much water out of, I guess that's probably be more in  your neck of the woods down south, you know, where you're having problems with the Colorado River  and whatever. So I think we'll see more and more of that. Alaska is usually the last to get in on those kinds  of things. That may, you know, eventually some alternate way than what we know now. Or, you know,  that we are familiar with. What might be the answer to some of this. I don't know. ",52:18
214,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So people are required to have some kind of water service. Whether it's once a month or once a week or  something. What do you what do you do when somebody doesn't, they just stop paying? ",53:10
209,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewee 1 ,We have the means to get heavy handed if we want to. Drag them into court. Do whatever they have to  do. ,53:23
212,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewee 2 ,But the last two years we couldn't do nothing to nobody. Yeah. Because the law says we can't because  covid. ,53:30
215,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewer 1 ,So you just eat the bill then or? ,53:37
213,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Yeah, I mean we try to collect. I mean there's like he said there's means for us to get it but. ",53:39
216,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, well sometimes it's you can't get blood out of a stone, right? I mean unless you're gonna take  somebody's house or. ",53:45
210,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,22,1,Interviewee 1 ,"I mean the only, the bet I think but you know the part that we're, when that happens where the where  we do get you know can get heavy handed is not really the water. It's the sewage because we know they're ",53:57
218,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,23,1,Interviewee 1 ,"dumping the sewage out o the tundra somewhere. Yeah, so and then we usually find a pile somewhere  and then we can go after the property owner. ",53:57
224,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,23,1,Interviewee 2 ,"Like a couple years ago, I had to go out to [REDACTED], pick up 27 honey buckets that somebody threw  on the side of the road. ",54:29
227,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,23,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So we do have some areas that are not, I mean, we don't drive water and sewer trucks out to [REDACTED]  right? or our [REDACTED] road. So we do have some established houses that are non-serviced? ",54:38

220,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,23,1,Interviewee 1 ,Well I wanted them to go a different way. But I'll take what I can get.  ,55:10

226,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,23,1,Interviewee 2 ,It's right in front of [REDACTED] house. ,55:18
229,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,23,1,Interviewer 1 ,Oh really? Is it not the same? ,55:18
222,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,23,1,Interviewee 1 ,"See I tried to do an alternate route here and I wanted to go this way. And but now they, because this thing  was this thing is 20 years old. They put it in the [REDACTED]. so we had to kind of live with where it was  when it started. But anyways, now all the traffic's gonna dump out into this neighborhood. Yeah. And I  don't know, exactly. ",55:21
230,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,23,1,Interviewer 1 ,But the [REDACTED] settled or? ,55:49
223,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,23,1,Interviewee 1 ,The eminent domain. ,55:52
235,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,24,1,Interviewer 1 ,Oh they just didn't have a choice. ,55:53
231,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,24,1,Interviewee 1 ,The state exercised eminent domain. ,55:55
236,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,24,1,Interviewer 1 ,"They got what they got. interesting. Huh? Well, that's off topic. but interesting.  ",55:57
232,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,24,1,Interviewee 1 ,It is kind of on topic because roads do allow water and sewer truck drivers to take a different route instead  of going around. ,56:06
238,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,24,1,Interviewer 4 ,So would they have to go? ,56:16
233,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,24,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Yeah, so here's [REDACTED] out here, somewhere and the water plants are down here. So you gotta, you  know, anyways, I've just, you know, it is a consideration where you put your water plant, they didn't have  a choice here, they did basically put the water plants where the neighborhoods were, when they started,  but now they're spread out and got further away. And then it's, you know, the next step, eventually, if we  start spreading out and is, you know, if you're in a village or someplace and your town is growing, is trying  to, that's what our preliminary engineering report is trying to figure out where your next water plant will  be to be able to push the water up, or lift station or so forth, out even further to whoever you're trying to  service. So the preliminary engineering report is, you know, if I had done it, we've done it maybe in  retrospect is, is just doing the whole town at once, not one neighborhood at a time. So because all the  engineering that goes into that work can be used down the road, instead of trying to do a little bit here.  And then they've got to change this here to make this fit here. And so we just gave up that we that's where  we're at was doing bits and pieces, not so small bits and pieces, but doing parts of it, we finally just said  we'll do the whole town. But so you know, a lot, a lot of times, like this grant funding, you know, what we  picked to do is kind of dependent upon how much money we get out of the grant. And it's not really  maybe the best way to go. So it's kind of driven by what you can get, and people kind of just look at that,  and they're not focused on the bigger picture. It's easy to go sideways that way. I think. ",56:19
237,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,24,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So seems like you two have a very strong opinion that piped water is a better way to live. Does the public  agree with you? I mean, are there people that, does everyone feel that way? Or some people like their  hauled water? ",58:06
234,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,24,1,Interviewee 2 ,"When we had the public meeting with the [REDACTED] people, they all seemed to want piped. I mean,  yeah, we had a little kickback from a couple of course, because of change. I wasn't here when they did  [REDACTED] but from what I understand about that, they kicked a lot. ",58:17
247,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewer 1 ,"That's I mean, I still hear people [REDACTED] about that. We never wanted this blah, blah, blah. ",58:35
239,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Oh, yeah. I think a lot of that though, is just what happened after the fact and all the mates, you know,  well, that was poorly built that was ",58:40
248,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I mean, I had I had a [REDACTED] electric bill this winter. ",58:47
244,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewee 2 ,I know I got the phone call ,58:50
240,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewee 1 ,"Right yeah. So I mean this is just my opinion of projects in general, but for water I think you need to be,  whoever is the owner needs to be actively involved. You just don't send somebody in there and go, ""go  do this"" ",58:51
245,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewee 2 ,I think pipe's a lot safer. In my opinion ,59:11
241,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,25,1,Interviewee 1 ,"It provides for fire hydrants is another big one. And then you know, just the daily use, I mean, you go out  wash your car where if you got 1000-gallon tank, you're kind of hesitant. So for keeping things clean, that's  [REDACTED] big push. [REDACTED] working on that set. But anyways, it's just staying clean. I hardly use  my bathtub because I got 1000-gallon tank and then you know your washer and dryer your washers  soaking up 47 gallons of water whatever it is. It goes quick. If you're waiting for the next load two weeks  down the road, with piped water you don't have to worry about that. ",59:15
200,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,21,1,Interviewee 1 ,There's a few. ,There's a few. 
206,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 1 ,21,1,Interviewer 1 ,When you're thinking about these things. Are there? Are there homes that are not on water? Anybody  that just doesn't?  ,When you're thinking about these things. Are there? Are there homes that are not on water? Anybody 
329,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,151,2,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah, definitely. So I work at [REDACTED]. And so I worked with [REDACTED], she actually grew up in  [REDACTED]. And what she wanted to do is kind of do a research project specifically focused on water  infrastructure in Alaska. And so we are funded [REDACTED] on kind of, I guess, two separate projects. But  what we're really trying to understand first is a little bit more of, you know, what are the challenges when  providing infrastructure in these rural communities, right, specifically water. And then we're also looking  a little bit more at kind of operator training and certification and some of the issues with more of the kind  of operations side, so once the system's built, and during when it's continued to be operational. And so  that's kind of the general scope of the project. And we're going to ask very kind of general questions at  the beginning. And so just any of your insights from work and in [REDACTED] or generally in Alaska as well,  that makes sense, or do you have any questions? ",00:26
324,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,151,2,Interviewee ,"Oh, it does. I mean, it just depending on your questions, it might be pretty hard for me to dial it back to  just [REDACTED]. You know, I do a lot of work throughout western Alaska. Obviously, [REDACTED] is a  community I work a lot in. But yeah, I just hope you're prepared to receive answers in relation to all of  Western and Northern Alaska. ",01:32
330,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,151,2,Interviewer 2 ,"Totally. And if there's anything specifically, you're thinking of a location, let us know. But any of your  insights are helpful. So you don't have to dial it back at all. Any insights from your experiences. The one  kind of thing we're specifically looking at is kind of the more rural regions, instead of, you know,  [REDACTED], or something. ",01:55
325,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,151,2,Interviewee ,Understood. ,02:13
327,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,151,2,Interviewer 1 ,"And I think that probably, I mean, I suspect that there'll be some commonalities, you know, I mean, some  of the technical, you know, is what the bedrocks like or whatever it might be, right might be different, but  I'm, I'm guessing, you know, the differences between like [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] or, you know,  something, probably, once you cross the border, and you know, it's not going to be, you know, wildly  different. So ",02:15
326,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,151,2,Interviewee ,"that's, oh, that's a fair assessment. Yeah. ",02:36
328,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,151,2,Interviewer 1 ,"So and the reason we're working in a team is that, so I'm gonna ask you some questions. And I might ask  you to repeat some things in a way that folks from [REDACTED] can, will make sense, right? Sometimes  when I do the interviews alone, you know, people are like, well, you know how it is. I do know how it is,  but can you say it? Anyways? So um, yeah, so I'll just start with some background about you. So you, ",02:40
335,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,152,1,Interviewer 1 ,"you're based in [REDACTED], you travel all around? Can you tell us about kind of how long you've been  doing, what you've been doing and what you do? ",02:40
331,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,152,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Well, so I'm with a consulting firm. And I've been with a consulting firm for [REDACTED] years now.  Predominantly water and water and sewer in western and northern Alaska. [REDACTED] Yeah,  [REDACTED] years is long enough to probably know my way around, but I don't think I don't think years  of experience is really a good substitute for. For much, I mean, yeah, you got to spend time out in the  field. And, you know, any, anybody that's five years and has the ability to innovate, so I don't hold  [REDACTED] years up as like a pinnacle of anything. ",03:20
336,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,152,1,Interviewer 1 ,And you're an engineer? Yes?  ,04:17
332,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,152,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. I'm a Professional Engineer. So my, my emphasis is water and sanitation. My degree is technically  in environmental engineering. ",04:21

338,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,152,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Super. So, the next series of questions have to do with how you work with water systems, and it sounds  like serving on a transactional or you know, a project basis, is that. Can you kind of describe what a typical  job would be? ",04:46
334,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,152,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, maybe it's, I mean, transactional is one word to describe it. I mean, I am private sector. So I am for  hire on things. I mean, I would love to just to be out there just, you know, doing stuff for free. But that's  not that's not where I'm at. I mean, [REDACTED] in a private sector engineering firm. So we're for hire,  you know, we're hired to design and construct projects. And, you know, that does require a lot of working  with operators and Public Works directors and owners and the public. But primarily, what I'm paid to do  is build and deliver a project that, you know, is operator friendly, and will be maintainable. That's the goal.  And, you know, we do also do other things, you know, we work with water plant operators to, you know,  optimize water quality and water treatment. And we'll do studies, feasibility type studies. But, yeah, I  mean, transaction is probably the right way to describe a lot of what we do. I mean, we're for hire. ",05:06
339,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,152,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Your clients are generally though, like public entities, like cities, or tribes or something? ",06:18
340,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,153,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, for the most part. We do a lot of work for municipalities. We do a lot of work for health corporations.  We do work directly for tribes. We do work directly for Native corporations also. We do get pulled into  projects for you know, [REDACTED], or like small private systems in western Alaska, also. But our bread  and butter are clients like the city of [REDACTED], the city of [REDACTED], [REDACTED]. ",06:26
344,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,153,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, that was so that's. And [REDACTED], that's kind of my connection is I was on the [REDACTED] City  Council. And when the municipality side, so when things come up that we don't have expertise or ability  to do, right, we contract someone to do it. Right. [REDACTED] ",06:59
341,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,153,1,Interviewee ,Water and sewer stuff. ,07:23
345,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,153,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Well, I already have a follow up question from what you said. So I'm gonna jump in real quick. But one of  the things you said was kind of when you're building, you're thinking about it being operator friendly and  maintainable? Can you expand a little bit more about how you kind of think about that? And, and what  you've maybe found successful in doing that? ",07:27
342,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,153,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, well, there's a lot of there's definitely a lot of complexities here. I mean, in general, I think that the  simpler, the better, you know, the simplest pump and the simplest operational package, the better, the  less things that can go wrong, the better. You know, a lot of the times the operators we work with are  brand new to the job, or they aren't going to be around for long, and you walk into a water plant or a  sewer lift station, and it's kind of like a rocket ship. It's like how the hell do you even run this thing? You  know, so the simpler, the better. But, um, you know, engineers have a way of complicating things and  making them super sophisticated and state of the art. And that does fall down a lot of the time, you know,  when there's unreliable power sources or stuff like that. So I like to keep it simple. But engineers have a  way of running away with things and making them more complex. And then also, you know, on the  drinking water side, and on the wastewater side, you know, we have certain standards that we have to  meet to the Department of Environmental Conservation and the EPA. So it's not like we can oversimplify  things and not get 4-log removal on bacteria at a water plant, you know, we have a certain standard,  where certain levels of simplicity would not be allowed because we have to meet this requirement. I  mean, it'd be great if we could have, you know, basic sand filters all over the place. They're super easy to  maintain, and, but we're not able to meet a certain standard with that kind of technology. ",07:48
346,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,153,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah, definitely. So balancing kind of the, you know, simplifying meeting regulations, as well as I mean, it  has to be also a lot harder to build these systems in some places in Alaska. ",09:34
343,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,153,1,Interviewee ,"Definitely, and more expensive. ",09:47
353,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,154,1,Interviewer 2 ,Take it away [REDACTED]. ,09:51
350,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,154,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. Well, and I'm sure we will have some more questions about those exact things. But before there's  something that you mentioned about, you know, working with, you know, working with tribes and  working with health corporations. Who like, how much time do you spend talking to people about water?  And who do you talk to? Do you ever talk to the public? Or is it? ",09:52
347,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,154,1,Interviewee ,"Well, we do. I mean, in my line of business, I mean, we're mainly working with the operators at a water  plant, or sewer plant, or sewer lift stations, you know, we're working with the people that run the  infrastructure, the Public Works directors, the utility line maintenance. But that being said, I mean, for big  piped water and sewer projects, we often have a major stakeholder outreach component where we need  to talk with the people that are going to get water and sewer service. And we need to, you know, talk with  the people we're going to get easements from, and agreements and all that. So we definitely have a  component of outreach with a big piped water and sewer project. And I mean, I was involved for a number  of years with [REDACTED], which was a, which was a project that, you know, basically looked at doing  household treatment instead of piped systems. [REDACTED]. So I have a fair amount of time talking to  people about honey buckets and the complexities of pipes versus on site treatment, all that kind of all  through Western and southwest Alaska. ",10:19
351,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,154,1,Interviewer 1 ,"It's a little bit afield, but I'm super curious, do you have any summary thoughts on working on the  [REDACTED]? building in houses versus big systems with pipes? ",11:43
348,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,154,1,Interviewee ,"Well, it was a great idea. And just, we went into it very optimistic thinking that, you know, basically, back  to what I said that we'll have this simple system where, you know, we'll have this vestibule and it'll attach  to the side of the house. And, you know, we'll have a granular activated carbon filter here, and then a  wastewater holding tank. And we just had this very simple approach. And it grew in complexity as we kept  trying to, like improve the disinfection. And by the end of the project and building these prototypes, I  mean, it was so complicated. It was no, no, no non engineer person could run this system. It just grew in  complexity. You know, so that was it was a much bigger challenge to do household treatment than we  thought it would be. And I bet you if you talk to the other teams, some at [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] had  a team. [REDACTED] had a team. Yeah, [REDACTED] had a team. ",11:56
352,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,154,1,Interviewer 1 ,"They sort of they sort of did their own thing, though. I think I think they maybe expanded beyond the  original scope or something. But yeah, they did. They I mean, I remember the I was in the warehouse with  the bubbling. ",12:59
349,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,154,1,Interviewee ,"And I think they came to one of the same conclusions that doing this on a household level is, it's hard. It's  not something that a typical homeowner is ready to take on from a maintenance perspective. ",13:12
358,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,155,1,Interviewer 1 ,"That was kind of the summary that I got, you know, is that shrinking a water treatment plant is very  challenging and turning a homeowner into a water plant operator. I mean, you know, it's hard enough to  find water plant operators at the water plant. And then, you know, so yeah, that was kind of the seemed  like, seemed like everyone was having that challenge. ",13:27
354,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,155,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Um, so I mean, that was the technology side, trying to basically take a full water plant, bring it down  into a household plant. That was the technology challenge. I mean, so there was, then there's gonna, you  know, the cultural challenge here. You know, there was some really big cultural hurdles to get over with  the idea of recycling water. You know, the idea of reusing water multiple times, you know, I know that,  you know, the city of San Francisco had to get over this hurdle to recycle water in that in that community.  And that's a hyper educated community. But, you know, the idea of recycling water and reusing it again,  did not sit well with a lot of people. You know, they thought that they were, you know, being compromised  essentially, of, ""Why doesn't [REDACTED] have to recycle water if you're asking us to do that?"" ",13:53
359,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,155,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Interesting. Was there. So, did you run into people just preferring to use sort of traditional water sources  or rain collection instead of mess with this whole thing?  ",14:53
355,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,155,1,Interviewee ,Definitely.  ,15:08
360,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,155,1,Interviewer 1 ,"How did those? I mean, when so, you know, you show up and you're like, hey, we're going to do this. I  mean, were people happy to talk to you? Or did they? How was? ",15:09
356,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,155,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I, you know, I think there's this divide in between water and sanitation. I really think that a lot of  rural Alaska does not like the honey bucket, they want flush toilets. They want you know, that part of it.  But as far as the drinking water, you know, traditional water sources, you know, the people in [REDACTED]  want to go to [REDACTED] because they've been going there forever to get their drinking water. So they  seem a lot more content to continue using drinking water, traditional sources. But I think everybody wants  flush toilets, and then, you know, the sanitation side to be handled via pipe system. ",15:18
361,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,155,1,Interviewer 1 ,"That's an interesting insight. We, you know, we've been talking really about the water delivery side when  we've talked to people but that is an interesting, I guess I can say, yeah, that's an interesting insight that  people do have, there's kind of a juxtaposition and how people feel about technology involved in taking  waste away versus bringing water in. ",15:56
357,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,155,1,Interviewee ,"Well, honey buckets aren't much fun. They're really, really an awful way to handle waste. ",16:18
365,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,156,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I don't, I don't care for that. So you work in all kinds of different communities? Can you give just a brief  overview of the types of water delivery systems that that you've had experience with or that you've seen? ",16:24
362,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,156,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, well, you know, the [REDACTED], you know, that's, that's a big, traditional rainwater capture area.  You know, people like to just gather rainwater off their roof for drinking and cooking. You know, so there's  the traditional sources like rainwater, and like creek water, [REDACTED], like I just mentioned. So that  would be like, no, no public distribution. And then you get up into the hauled systems. So there's, you  know, a variety of hauled systems out there, obviously, you know, the way the city of [REDACTED] does it  is big water haul trucks, but you have to have a road network for these big haul trucks. You know, they're  80,000 pounds each. So unless you have like a good road system, you're not going to have a haul truck  network. Some of the other communities like you know, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], you know, they  have kind of the four-wheeler hauled system where they're hauling water to a cistern at each of the house  using a four wheeler delivery system. So traditional, hauled, and then piped. On the pipe side, you know,  there's a number of different ways to do it. Almost all of the systems in Alaska, they circulate for freeze  protection. But we always go into a project and evaluate do we need to go above ground with the pipes?  Do we need to go below ground? How do we how do we build out the pipe network? and that is incredibly  location specific. You know, there's a lot of above ground pipe systems in the [REDACTED], just because  of the frost susceptibility of soils and the likelihood of great amounts of movement. If when you're burying  pipes in that kind of environment, you tear them apart. So that's why you see this spaghetti noodles, of,  you know, above ground pipe in [REDACTED] a lot. ",16:39
366,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,156,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I've got, I've got that in the backyard. I painted mine. So it blends in with the trees a little bit. I did some  patterns on there. ",18:38
363,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,156,1,Interviewee ,"But you go to [REDACTED], and everything, we bury everything up there. We bury everything in  [REDACTED]. So better, better, less frost susceptible soils up that way. ",18:46
367,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,156,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I noticed that you ordered, you know, you listed those different types of delivery systems in a way that  felt sequential. I mean, the people that you're working with, is it is pipe is a pipe system preferable? ",18:58
364,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,156,1,Interviewee ,"I think so. I think that's the gold standard. I think I think that's the gold standard. Yeah. Um, you know,  we've talked you know, we do a number of like preliminary engineering reports where we kind of assess  the alternatives for providing water and sewer and, you know, there are certain communities that are just  really, you know, they've just been, I don't know, they just want pipes. You know, we're experiencing this  in [REDACTED] right now where they just want pipes especially on the sewer side. ",19:13
371,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,157,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And over, you know, you said you've been doing this for [REDACTED] years. So is there you know, we think  about remote Alaska is there progress that direction? is water provision, is there more pipes than there  used to be? Are things better than they were?  ",19:50
368,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,157,1,Interviewee ,"Well, that's a good question. I mean, I say that not just for a pause, I say that because the rate of  degradation is probably faster than the rate of improvement. You know, so [REDACTED] gets a new system  and [REDACTED] gets the institutional corridor and [REDACTED] gets some new circulating loops. But the  rate at which they're degrading all the infrastructure built in between the 60s and 80s, is falling apart. So  I don't know if things are technically getting better there. They're may be maintaining. But I mean, clearly,  we have some massive, massive funding, spending coming up in the next year, year and a half. I mean,  there's never been this kind of windfall for rural water and sanitation that I've, since I've been practicing. ",20:04
372,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,157,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, so in that kind of. Since when this study was planned, this is new information. So can you say a little  bit about that? And how you see that affecting rural and remote Alaska? ",20:53
369,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,157,1,Interviewee ,"Well, I certainly hope you're like interviewing some funding agency type people. Are you guys? Somebody  with IHS, USDA? You got people like that? ",21:06
374,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,157,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah, we actually, yeah, we've done kind of this is the second part of the project, where we're looking  more kind of regionally, but we are just kind of wrapping up talking to a lot of more state level  stakeholders. And so we also have like a white paper and stuff we can share if you're interested. But we  did talk to kind of the state level and national organizations, which it's interesting to hear the different. ",21:17
373,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,157,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And that's why I think it'd be interesting to hear from you as well. Because I mean, a lot of these things  are, you know, developing right now, right? Looks like there's gonna be some money and okay, there's  gonna be some money. Okay, here's it. There's a ton of money, but how that's going to trickle down,  whether through the tribes or the municipalities or the health corporations. I'm not clear on I mean, so  what would what do you see? ",21:45
370,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,157,1,Interviewee ,"Well, yeah, I mean, I guess I brought that up, just because I feel like I'm not the best one to answer it, you  know, as the for hire guy, the guy that's out there building stuff and making it happen. I'm not responsible  for how the funding makes it to [REDACTED] or makes it to the city of [REDACTED]. You know, I'm sort of  aware of where the money's going just because, you know, they're my clients and, you know, sometimes  they need help with grant applications or something. But, you know, the funding made available through  the Jobs Act and all that is it for mainly, I mean, it appears from what I'm seeing that most of its going  through to IHS and will be distributed through the SDS sanitation deficiency system programming, so a lot  of a lot of IHS money. And [REDACTED] will be managing and running a lot of those projects on behalf of ",22:05
375,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,158,1,Interviewee ,"IHS or with IHS funding. This is not like I mean, as a consulting engineer, though, this is not where I operate,  though. So I probably just messed something up there. ",22:05
379,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,158,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I got you. I mean, it's interesting to hear from you, because you're on the other side. Right? You. So you  would have customers that would have money that didn't used to have money, right? So you could be  looking at projects that were maybe never feasible until now. Yeah. So that's exciting, right? ",23:18
376,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,158,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. I mean, a lot of a lot of those projects that were economically infeasible, just because of the unit  cost of distributing and collecting water and sewer on a per unit basis has been so high, you know, the  money that's available right now, will be available for some of these economically infeasible type projects,  these projects that are 200 or $300,000 per house for water and sewer systems. Yeah, it's crazy. But that  is the cost of providing a full piped water and sewer system in one of these small communities. ",23:34
380,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,158,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So kind of, probably related to that, if we're if we're looking at you know, can you talk a little bit about I  know, it's a really broad topic, but what are the what are the challenges delivering water to people in the  in the communities you work in? ",24:13
377,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,158,1,Interviewee ,"deliver, like delivering via the haul system or just? ",24:31
381,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,158,1,Interviewer 1 ,All of the above if our goal is to get good potable water to somebody at their house. Right? Why is that so  hard? ,24:37
378,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,158,1,Interviewee ,"Um, well, honestly, I think cost is the biggest challenge and you know, the federal funding package might  be able to, you know, overcome some of that. You know, it It's just the cost of delivery and the cost of  capital projects and the cost of and just the cost of operating those systems. I think that's the biggest  challenge you know, and I just threw some numbers out there about two or $300,000 for capital  investment for pipe water and sewer to homes and [REDACTED] or whatnot. Um, you know, that's, that  does that number seems so big, but if you look at [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], you know, a  bigger Alaska community, you know, the investment over time, you know, to build out the pipe network  and all these lift stations over time, you are putting a couple 100 grand into water and sewer for each  building. If you look at the investment over time of the 15 different well pump houses in [REDACTED], the  three water treatment plants, the four wastewater plants, if you look at that investment over the course  of history, that's a lot of investment. And then here we are in [REDACTED], at $200,000 or 240. That's a  one-time investment to provide a pipe water and sewer system all at once. So I think that the critique  about the cost being so high is not really fair, because it's not capturing the long term investment of a  bigger community. ",24:49
384,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,159,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Interesting. And so, why is it so expensive? ",26:25
382,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,159,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, building conditions are hard. You know, the [REDACTED] in particular is a tough  area to build anything. I mean, remoteness is one thing. But all you know, remoteness is just one thing.  The conditions unique to the [REDACTED] are really poor building, building, really poor ground.  groundwater table is basically at the ground surface, especially in the [REDACTED]. Where it is, the  groundwater is at the same level as, as the ground surface, so anything underground becomes very  difficult. And then the [REDACTED] nature, the alluvial soils and whatnot are very frost susceptible. So  there's a lot of ground movement. In order to guarantee that things will stay in place, you almost have to  put them on some sort of support that penetrates the ground, helical supports, driven piles all that. So  the ground movement is a unique challenge to the [REDACTED]. The remoteness is a challenge to all of  Alaska, seasonal barge, you know, seasonal barge limitations. You know, politicians always bring that up.  And it is a good point. But that's only one thing ",26:31
385,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,159,1,Interviewer 1 ,How about on the operation side? ,27:56
383,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,159,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, yeah, there's definitely operational challenges. You know, a lot of the times the utility can only pay a  certain amount for an operator. You know, they're not, they're not 100 $200,000 A year jobs where you're  really going to retain somebody for a long period of time. I mean, for the retention of that person, the  [REDACTED] of [REDACTED] water treatment plant that's been there for [REDACTED], those guys are not  motivated by money. They're motivated by [REDACTED] has been the water plant operator at [REDACTED]  Water Plant since [REDACTED], or whatever. The you know, those guys are almost impossible to find that  want to make a life out of being a water sewer operator, the wages aren't good enough to retain people.  There's not enough income, there's not enough revenue for the utility to have money to pay people what  they deserve to run a water plant. So there's high, high turnover in the operations. And you know, you  need time to understand how to run a polymer pump at a water plant or to develop these skills. So  turnover within operations is probably the biggest challenge I see. The inability to retain staff that know  how to run these systems. And then unfortunately, you know, we work with the community of  [REDACTED]. You know, there was just a house fire up in [REDACTED]. Last week, and unfortunately, it  killed [REDACTED]. So, you know, [REDACTED] is down the one person that they had that could run that  plant. I mean, that's a very extreme example, but you know, when you don't have any redundancy within  your operational ranks and you lose the lead guy. I mean [REDACTED] is bound to have some trouble in  the coming year. ",28:02
386,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,159,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Well, and I don't think that's an unusual situation. Right. So even in [REDACTED], we have two water  plants. And, you know, there's been times where we've had one water plant operator. And, you know,  probably, you know, I mean, that's, that's where you lose something like the ability to fluoridate or, you  know. So what thoughts do you have? What do we do about that? Any ideas on addressing that challenge? ",30:06
387,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,160,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, well, so [REDACTED] is developing, like a cooperative utility. Have you talked anybody at  [REDACTED]? No? They might be a good one to talk to. Yeah, they're working with a grant from the  [REDACTED], which is a kind of a faith, sort of faith based nonprofit, but they're working on this  cooperative utility model. So taking all of the utilities in the [REDACTED] Region -- [REDACTED], and  basically administering the utility as a cooperative. So [REDACTED] is responsible for all the training and  has their own RMWs, remote maintenance workers, that drift around the region, billing, everything is  done on a cooperative utility basis. Everybody has the same pumps at their sewer lift stations, everybody  has the same household circulation pumps for the water. All that, you know, so they're administering the  utility as one instead of [REDACTED] separate utilities. And that way, you know, one operator could be  you could you could, you know, we got somebody in [REDACTED] that can go to [REDACTED] for a while  and everybody's trained on the same equipment, instead of everyone having different things. ",30:35
392,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,160,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So, I mean, so is that like [REDACTED]? ",32:07
388,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,160,1,Interviewee ,"It is, but it's more regional and way more specific. But yes, [REDACTED] would be a larger version of that. ",32:11
393,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,160,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay. And they do. They're doing the, like, the training of the operators too, not just fix stuff when they  go out there. ",32:18
389,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,160,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, yeah. And stockpiling spare, you know, chemical feed pumps. And, you know, just, yeah, more than  what [REDACTED] does. I mean, [REDACTED], obviously has their own remote maintenance workers and  they do billing for some communities. But I mean, this this, this model that [REDACTED] is working on is  way more regional specific. ",32:25
394,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,160,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So if I am a water plant operator in [REDACTED], do I work? Who do I work for?  ",32:48
390,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,160,1,Interviewee ,You would work for the cooperative utility.  ,32:54
395,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,160,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay, so I don't work for the city or the tribe?  ",32:57
391,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,160,1,Interviewee ,"well, this model, just so you know, is not the I mean, there's a project right now to develop this. So it's not  all sorted out, you know, it's a two to three year process to try to establish how this cooperative utility  would work. And, you know, they're working with every community to make sure that this would be  something they'd be interested in. You know, it's, you know, it's similar to like the tribal compacts, I mean,  [REDACTED] for one, [REDACTED], you know, it's similar to [REDACTED], where you're kind of bringing all  the utilities together to have combined purchasing power, combined training. Similar systems, all that. ",33:02
399,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,161,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I think there's, there's economies of scale, that kind of I mean, are make everything cheaper. And I  certainly know in in, you know, in my region, in the [REDACTED], just like you said, having pumps having  the same pumps, you know, and having, it's hard for an individual community to have an extra one of  everything that they might need. But if you're, you know, again, working with a half a dozen communities,  then having a warehouse makes sense, all of a sudden, yeah. ",33:45
396,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,161,1,Interviewee ,"And I mean, [REDACTED] could be that centralized cooperator. And to a certain extent, you know, the  [REDACTED], well, you know, you know, more than me about this, [REDACTED]. Sorry, sorry, [REDACTED].  This is why like, [REDACTED] is in the middle. ",34:16
400,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,161,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I do know, but could you tell me? ",34:34
397,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,161,1,Interviewee ,"You know, like, [REDACTED] has a structure where they could be the centralized cooperator for a  centralized cooperative utility, and they already to a certain extent with [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], are  doing that. ",34:37
401,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,161,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay, well, that seems that seems promising. I want to we'll jump back for a second, but I do want to talk  a little bit about operators. You work with operators, you talk with operators, you've mentioned earlier  about designing systems, hopefully that would be easy to operate. But we also talked about how  sometimes we're short operators, and we can't. What are the challenges about training operators? You  know, you mentioned salary, are there other barriers? ",34:50
398,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,161,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Well, you know, a lot of water and sewer infrastructure, you know, at a water plant is, you know,  it's, it's, it's complicated, it's complicated. You know, it requires a person that is very mechanically savvy.  But also, you know, also willing to, you know, work with computers and remote monitoring systems, I  mean, it can be it, there can be a lot to that job. And sometimes the community will have an operator  position open. And, you know, because of lack of employment, somebody that really does not have the  appropriate skills, gets that job, doesn't have the correct capacities, I would say, to run a complicated  treatment plant or even a pump station. So I mean, I'm trying to hit on another, you know, just like  capacity for the right type of person, is another challenge. Yeah, yeah. Beyond salary. ",35:21
402,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,161,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I think a lot of a lot agencies and organizations probably feel that in it in a general sense. Something that  we've heard from other people we've interviewed was about the kind of the testing and the, you know,  the certification process around operators, and that, and that, that has been that's been challenging, right  to get not just get people hired, but then also get them trained.  ",36:24
403,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,162,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, no, there's definitely people but there's definitely certain people that don't like to take tests too.  And that's a learning environment that doesn't really work for certain people. You know, the certification  levels and to go through and be certified, you have to be pretty committed to like making this your career  path. And a lot of people that just you know, pick up an operator job just want a paycheck for a while. ",36:54
406,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,162,1,Interviewer 1 ,Just you mean committed because the amount of time that it takes? ,37:21
404,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,162,1,Interviewee ,The time and the studying and the investment of your mental capital to achieve that certification. ,37:26
407,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,162,1,Interviewer 1 ,"We're gonna jump to some other questions. But before I do, [REDACTED], am I missing anything? You  have any? ",37:38
409,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,162,1,Interviewer 2 ,I don't think so. You've asked a lot of the questions I was going to. ,37:45
408,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,162,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I did want to hit on one thing specifically, you know, so weather is an issue, right? Heaves in the alluvial  soils is a particular challenge. Is there? Is there a time of year where we have more infrastructure  challenges? I'm assuming winter, but you know, Is that Is that true? Is that a good assumption? ",37:51
405,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,162,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I don't know. I guess winter would be, um, you know, a lot of our systems are above ground in  western Alaska, and they're very susceptible to freezing. You know, all the all the circulation systems and  the heat tray systems and all that. I mean, they're, they're, they're well designed, but they're fragile still,  you know, if the boiler at the water plant goes out, and we lose the ability to heat the water and sewer  with the glycol, that's gonna lead to freeze ups. And you know, there's a certain amount of like  homeowner responsibility with keeping their water and sewer service from freezing up, you got to  remember to turn the heat trace on got to remember to have the circulation pump on and these you  know, these little things if that sounds really simple, just remember to turn on your heat trace when it  gets cold. But you know, us here in this urban environment of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] and  [REDACTED], we don't have to remember to go downstairs and turn on the heat trace when it starts  getting cold. Or maybe you're out hunting. So, you know, there's, there's, there's ways we can design but  you know, there's fragility in these systems, you know, they have to circulate, they have to be heat traced.  And you know, when you have a water main freeze, it doesn't just affect that one person that's closest to  the freeze it affects the entire the entire network, so the whole system will go down. And then, you know,  sometimes you know utility isn't even able to get it back once it freezes, because it's too much to get it  thawed. Yeah, you know, so winter- clear challenges with the climate, more ground movement happens  on the shoulder seasons where you're having the breakup and, and, and the frost action. So ground  movement would be greater in the shoulder seasons. And then the springtime often presents another  unique challenge with the amount of infiltration and inflow that happens in the sewer systems, you know, ",38:20
410,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,163,1,Interviewee ,"so that's all the meltwater from the snow. That's all the melt water from the snow going into the lift  stations and, you know, causing failures. We see this a lot in [REDACTED], where the storm drain system  isn't working well. So the whole community gets flooded out. Flooding, yeah, that's another big issue. Boy,  like as I'm talking [REDACTED], I realize that there's kind of challenges at every single season. And then  another challenge is, you know, drinking water plants that have their water source as a surface water  source will often see like an algal bloom in June, July, when there's highest amounts of photosynthesis.  And that presents a very unique challenge to some communities where you have very compromised raw  water. ",38:20
413,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,163,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay. So that's looking at kind of seasonal change. If we go back a little bit, have you in the time you've  been working on this? Do you think that there? Have you seen sort of evidence of climate change making  things harder in general? ",41:24
411,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,163,1,Interviewee ,"Well, okay, I guess two things to point out when it comes to climate change and actual observations. So  we've had, we've had the unique pleasure, unique opportunity to drill like at many different locations in  [REDACTED] for buildings, and water and sewer pipelines and all that. So we've observed the permafrost  depth diving in the [REDACTED]. And the [REDACTED] in particular, the permafrost is not very good,  because the historic annual average is right at about freezing. You know, you go up to [REDACTED], or  whatnot, the average annual temperature is 5 or 6 C below freezing. So their permafrost is more reliable.  But we've seen the permafrost diving in [REDACTED] area, you know, where it's getting deeper and deeper  and more fragile. So that means deeper and deeper piles and deeper and deeper piers for all these  supports, because we need to get it into the permafrost for it to be founded. So there's that. Then the  other thing I would say is, there's been a marked increase in disinfection byproducts at water plants. So  we you know, we think this has to do with just increased surface water temperatures, basically providing  for faster kinetic rates for the chemical reactions to happen that form disinfection byproducts. Two kinds  of climate change observations that I've seen. ",41:44
414,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,163,1,Interviewer 1 ,"That's, that's really good insight. Yeah. So we, I mean, we'd heard some about like, erosion and that sort  of thing. And then you know, melting permafrost. So we had a water plant, and you know, all of a sudden  it starts sinking. That's, that's bad news. ",43:29
412,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,163,1,Interviewee ,"Well, definitely. And, you know, a lot of Alaska's villages are constructed on rivers, and they're constructed  on, you know, coastlines, where they were always going to be erosion. So sometimes it's harder to really  point the finger definitively to say that climate change is responsible for that. Because, you know, rivers  have been eroding since the beginning of time. But, you know, it's, yeah. ",43:42
415,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,163,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But I mean, drilling soil samples. And I mean, that's, that's pretty. Pretty concrete. Yeah.  So kind of with a lot of these things in mind that we talked about if you were working with a community  that was wanting to develop water infrastructure, right, move along that spectrum that we talked about. ",44:13
419,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,164,1,Interviewer 1 ,How do you think your way through that process? To make sure that you were doing all the things that  you talked about and setting them up for success? ,44:13
416,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,164,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Well, hopefully your community has some strong leadership that's committed to the idea because  it takes a long time. You know, just because you want a piped water and sewer system doesn't mean it,  it's going to be there next year, you know, it takes leadership that's very committed to the idea of it, and  somebody to chaperone it through the whole process. You know, starting at the planning level at  preliminary engineering reports and master plans that really kind of engage the community early on, to  really come to a solution that is adequate for that community. A lot of the times if these decisions and the  stakeholder engagement doesn't happen very early, it won't happen. You know, once a consultant or a  firm has a contract for a design, it's very specific, this is what we're going to do. And then when it comes  to construction, it's even less flexible. So I think the master planning and the preliminary engineering  reports and that front end stuff is really the best time for the proper community engagement. Because  once you get further into the process, it gets harder and harder to make changes. ",44:49
420,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,164,1,Interviewer 1 ,"You know, I know we've hit on some of these themes before, but I guess, if you were, if you were going  to change something, if you could fix one thing, to hopefully improve the situation of the challenges we've  had with water delivered infrastructure, what would you change? Where would you attack the problem?  You know? ",46:16
417,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,164,1,Interviewee ,"Oh boy. I don't know, man, gonna draw a blank when it comes to one thing. Hmm, well. Sorry. This one's  a little off guard about one thing. ",46:38
421,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,164,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So let me let me let me frame it in another way. You had mentioned early on money, right? That, you  know, it's money if we had if we had more money. So if you had money, if you had all the money, then  what would you what would you do with the money? What's the best way to spend that money? ",47:01
418,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,164,1,Interviewee ,"Ah, see, I'm going to answer that question by not answering that one either. I don't think that money is  the one thing that's needed. I mean, obviously, that is a big thing, because you got to build all this  infrastructure. But maintenance and the ongoing upkeep is, is why that $2.3 billion, that's going to drift  into Alaska in the next five years, we're going to be repairing systems again, in 25 years, you know, the  ongoing operational and maintenance. Um, that's, that's the biggest challenge. I think it's not the climate,  it's not the money, it's the ongoing operation and ownership of these systems. So if I were to change one  thing, I would get, you know, people and communities all over the world to think about water as, as a  more precious resource, and something that is of greater value. So is this an education thing, where, you  know, we would celebrate being the water treatment plant operator, or the sewer plant operator,  because they are, you know, contributing to society at a very high level. But right now, I mean, it's an $18  an hour job to fix sewer lift stations, it's not sexy, it's not, the attitude towards water and sewer. If I were ",47:21
422,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,165,1,Interviewee ,"to change anything, that would be what I would change to make it more heralded, celebrated. Make it as  important as it really is to public health professionals.  ",47:21
426,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,165,1,Interviewer 1 ,That's a good answer. I like that answer.  ,49:00
423,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,165,1,Interviewee ,"So how do you do that? Well, lots of education. I don't know, change the culture, I guess. ",49:04
427,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,165,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. But I think, you know, that is a question that I've asked, I think repeatedly as we've been doing  interviews is, you know, is, is this is just, is this just a money problem? Right, like, if we, if we had, you  know, all the money we needed, would it solve these problems? And, you know, so it's, it's, I guess, it's  interesting to think about, as, you know, part of when you were describing that was, you know, it's a  people issue, too, right. All the money in the world doesn't matter if you don't have the what the  operations and the maintenance is unique, you know? ",49:11
424,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,165,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I mean, the money is great. And you know, and personally, it's going to be very good for my business.  I mean, we're going to be building and designing water and sewer systems all over the place. So, you  know, it's good for a lot of people in the business but I don't see it as the silver bullet that this $2.3 billion  is going to fix all the problems. ",49:45
428,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,165,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay. I want to take a little pause as our time is getting short here, [REDACTED], do you have any questions  you want to jump in with? ",50:08
429,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,165,1,Interviewer 2 ,"I don't think so. So I guess just one last question would be, do you have any other insights about kind of  specifically that operator training piece? So a little bit more background about the project, that's kind of  the direction we're going is trying to kind of bring together some of this, like, basically figure out a way to  do operations a little bit better, and support operators in actually doing their job, right, maybe not passing  the certification test, but do you have any additional thoughts on that? ",50:18
425,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,165,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, well, if we could pay operators more, if there was a way to do that, I mean, I think it would be a way  to, to recognize their contributions, and it would be a way to hold on to them longer. You know, in my, in  my world, I can be pretty frustrated where even with a big community like [REDACTED], where I'll fly out  there. And it'll you know, it's a revolving door of operators. So like, I don't ever see how they can develop  the skills they need to do their job effectively. You know, we're just we're going through the exact same  thing again, right now, where [REDACTED], the leader of the utility management group is leaving so I don't  know who's going to replace him. You know, so um, yeah, trying to get back to your question about what  could be done to be more effective. Um, you know, bringing in bringing in the operators to [REDACTED]  and [REDACTED] is kind of a double-edged sword. A lot of the times when they come in [REDACTED], ",50:57
430,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,166,1,Interviewee ,"there's trouble that is, there's there can be trouble. I'll just leave it at that. [REDACTED], you can connect  the dots later if you need to. ",50:57
435,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,166,1,Interviewer 1 ,I will connect the dots later. Yeah. ,52:11
431,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,166,1,Interviewee ,"But they come in. I mean, if they're in the community of [REDACTED], you know, knowing how to operate  that filter in that, that, that peristaltic pump or whatnot. I mean, like training at their facility would be, I  think, more advantageous than bringing them in to a classroom setting in [REDACTED], or even  [REDACTED]. So, you know, maybe one critique is that it could be more community by community. I  generally just think that operators need to be celebrated more and paid more, though. ",52:14
436,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,166,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Another question on that, that that has come up is, you know, the certification process right that that this  is a national certification, and it might not be a very small amount of that might apply to what's happening  in [REDACTED]. Right. So how do you what do you? Do you feel like that it's important that everyone has  a standardized training versus you know, trying to break that up and not have standardization but really  maybe somebody would only be able to know their system in [REDACTED]. ",52:55
432,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,166,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Well, that's an argument for a cooperative utility where you know, you have [REDACTED] utilities  that all look the same where you know, if you know how to run the [REDACTED] water plant you know  how to run it in [REDACTED] and you know how to run it in [REDACTED]. You know, so you could take that  operator from [REDACTED] and bring them over to [REDACTED] and we all have very similar water plants.  So that knowledge would be transferable back to that community. ",53:30
437,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,166,1,Interviewer 1 ,"But right now, I mean, the pathway that we put water plant operators on is to train them to run a water  plant in Chicago. ",54:00
433,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,166,1,Interviewee ,"Right it's very standardized and it's in a classroom usually in [REDACTED] so I yeah, I don't know if that's  the best setup for success. ",54:06
438,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,166,1,Interviewer 1 ,"That's something that has been discussed in the past. The State of Alaska had their own certification, right.  And then we went with a national standard. ",54:16
434,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,166,1,Interviewee ,Yeah. Yeah. Some big some big challenges here. Takes a lot of great minds. ,54:28
445,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Well, so this has been great. What should I have asked you? What did I miss here? Anything else you want  to add for us? ",54:38
439,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewee ,"I mean, just like a public health doctor, you know, family practitioner something ",55:00
446,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewer 1 ,north of 200. Right.  ,55:04
440,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. And, you know, here, you know, water and sewer people are public health professionals. And why  the basic salary on a water plant job is 50 or 60. You know, they are public health professionals too, and I  think they should be treated as such. But I feel like culturally, we're not doing that right now. ",55:06
447,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewer 1 ,"That's a good point. Yeah, that's true. I think you can make a pretty good case for clean drinking water  and health. We have some evidence of that. There's been some studies.  ",55:33
441,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewee ,"There's tons of studies. That's, if there's if there's any, any one thing that's responsible for the  advancements in life expectancy, it's water and sanitation systems. That's the biggest jump in like, life  expectancy, essentially. ",55:43
448,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I think that in this state, too. There's great examples of that. I mean, even you know, in, in the last 50  years, when you look at, you know, I mean, it's made a huge difference in this in this state. ",56:01
442,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. I wonder if [REDACTED] is still kicking around? The to go with? So yeah, ",56:13
449,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewer 1 ,"He is. So he retired, and then they pulled him back in. So he's doing some stuff with the university now  with [REDACTED]. I bump into him every once in a while. And of course, you know, it's been kind of all  hands on deck for COVID stuff for the last two years. But yeah, I usually, I usually bump into him. ",56:18
443,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,167,1,Interviewee ,"Okay. Well, he was a guy that could cite those sorts of improvements. very readily at his fingertips. He had  examples of introduction of a water and sewer system and what effect it had and ",56:37
453,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,168,1,Interviewer 1 ,"well, great, I guess, you know, if, let's see, thank you so much for your time. If there's anything that comes  up later, do you mind if we contact you, again, to clarify or ask additional questions? Okay. One thing that  we might be looking for is pictures of water systems or even, you know, I don't know, reports, or  information, training manuals, that sort of thing. For water systems, so we might reach out again on that  and see, I don't know [REDACTED] what the best way to do that is, but just, okay. If we call you Yeah. ",56:53
451,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,168,1,Interviewee ,"All right. Well, no, I'm committed to the profession. You know, so I'm happy to help fellow practitioners,  so and people that are trying to make a difference in this. So yeah, no problem. ",57:38
454,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,168,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yep. And so we'll be in. I'll be in [REDACTED] regularly, but the [REDACTED] will be in [REDACTED] next  week, right. And then be coming up again, probably in June. So we'll be back and forth. So yeah, maybe  we'll talk more. ",57:50
452,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 10 ,168,1,Interviewee ,I was debating a trip out there next week. What day what days? Were you thinking? Just curious. ,58:08

463,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,169,10,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  I didn't know that. Is that like [REDACTED] or? ,58:08
464,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,169,11,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  So it was actually- ,58:08

471,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,169,18,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  And where did you come from? ,58:08
472,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,169,19,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  [REDACTED] I had boating experience and on lakes and stuff so it was kind of a natural  transition. ,58:08
473,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,169,20,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  That's cool. I'm Learning stuff. Most people move here for a job, so you moved here  because you wanted to live here? ",58:08
474,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,169,21,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Yeah and a position opened up. ,58:08
475,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,1,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. What was that? ,58:08
476,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,2,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  That was utility management. ,58:08
477,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,3,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. ,58:08
478,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So that which, excuse me. So what I did was I partnered with community leadership, so  whether it be either a city council or a tribal council, depending on the community, and  then we would go over how they ran their utilities. The large percentage of them it was  well water and sewer utilities, but some actually own their electrical utility. So then what  we would do is I would teach them how to pull profit and loss, or how to track, how much  does actually cost to make a gallon of water? ",58:08
479,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,5,Interviewee ,"Once you include your labor, all of your chemicals, your shipping, your electrical bills, your  fuel to heat the water plant, also your fuel to warm the water to a degree that allows the  chemicals to do what they need to do. So we would do that. So I did that until the grant,  the federal grant funding ran out and it wasn't renewed like [REDACTED]. ",58:08
480,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,6,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  And was that all through the [REDACTED] communities or specific ones? ,58:08
481,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  It was specific ones. [REDACTED]. And [REDACTED] was through the transition from haul  to, or honey bucket to piped. ",58:08
482,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,8,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. ,58:08
483,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,9,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Which was an interesting transition. Oh and [REDACTED] for a little bit. ,58:08
484,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Okay. So you worked at [REDACTED] but the money was coming from the federal  government, the grant and then … So if I'm a tribal council in the village what- ",58:08
485,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,11,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So the way it would work was like it was USDA actually provided 80% of the funds, I think  it was, something like that anyway. And then what we would do is we would advertise for  lack a better term, that hey, we have this opportunity, if you'd like to be a part of it, here's  the application. So they would put an application and then they would review the  application, and then we would partner with them to run it. Some weren't interested, a  lot of them were, some of them were only in the program for like a year, other ones were  in the program real intensively for a year, and then slowly tapered off as they got better  with it. ",58:08
486,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,170,12,Interviewee ,"And to understand it, they needed less and less of my help, so then a more intensive  community that needed more intensive work. I would partner with them and do the other  one part-time. And some just stayed like … they were a disaster. So they just need a lot  of help all the time. The [REDACTED] one, that was like a never-ending help. But now  [REDACTED], we were real busy out there for the first year and a half. And then once every ",58:08
487,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,171,1,Interviewee ,"couple months I might go out there. A lot of the stuff could be handled over the phone  email, things like that. ",58:08
488,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,171,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  So were you working with administrators about bookkeeping and cost billing, that kind of  thing? Or did you work with operators about turning valves and stuff too? Or when things  break? ",58:08
489,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,171,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So, I didn't do the operator portion of it, that was actually handled. So I would partner  with the [REDACTED] for that, and they would come out and do operator training. I would  work with councils, administrators or councils administrators, some places had utility  clerks, and we would go over everything from billing rates to collection rates, to things  like that. So depending on the information we were trying to gather, dictate a lot of who  I worked with. ",58:08
490,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,171,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  And from the perspective of the tribes, is there any other incentive for me other than I  just need … I don't understand. Were you mostly teaching or were you doing the work, or  is there like helping them get money or what? ",58:08
491,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,171,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Both? So I would educate and then as they started to take over, then it would be more of  a … I would educate and do it, a lot of it, and then I would just oversee after that. So some  communities they didn't know what it cost to make a gallon the water, so I would build  an extensive spreadsheet and lock cells, and then provide them with that data. So then  they would be able to easily input the electric bill for the building, the fuel bill this month.  And then this is our collection rate, this is what our income was. ",58:08
492,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,171,6,Interviewee ,"And at the last page then it would kick out how much it cost to make a gallon water that  month, their expenses, and then it would have income- ",58:08

494,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,171,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  How much you're losing on making, depending on … some communities did really well  like [REDACTED], they did great. They got, I don't know, by now they probably have 30,  40 grand just sitting there. Because they figured out what it costs to make a gallon, how  to cut cost and then, found their pipe system. ",58:08
495,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,171,9,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  So that's a fairly unique job. What was your experience or educational background that  set you up for that job? ,58:08
496,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,171,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  I guess what experience was probably the ability to travel because I've been coming up  since [REDACTED]. So I've traveled a lot out here, I've been to multiple communities and  had a lot cultural interaction, [crosstalk] cross culture communication. So from the very  get go, I could get myself from [REDACTED] to the community and back without help. And  that's probably one of your biggest obstacles out here, is being able to get on machines,  and make it to the village and make it home. ",58:08
497,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,172,1,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Okay. So it wasn't like, we need someone who's really good at spreadsheets. ",58:08
498,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,172,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  It was less about business management and more about the ability to connect with  people. If you can't connect with them, it doesn't matter what your information is  because you're not going to listen to you. ",58:08
499,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,172,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  So, now that it's been a couple years, if you were going to fill that role, you still feel that  way, you'd hire somebody that could get around and teach them the other part, rather  than hire someone that was a business manager and try to teach them how to- ",58:08

502,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,172,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  I do for … as much as a community wanted to make it successful, the uniqueness on that  program versus other programs was, I didn't have any power to make any decisions. I  didn't have any money to persuade them to make any of decisions. My whole job hinged  on whether they bought into it or not. ",58:08
503,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,172,7,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  They sort of believed you or yeah trusted you. ,58:08
504,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,172,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So I have like [REDACTED] were probably, and [REDACTED], they were the ones that really  took hold of it. Other communities, they took the information, but they didn't really want  to own it, they kind of wanted somebody else to do it. And that just wasn't the way the  program was. Like I said, [REDACTED], I bet now they got 40 grand sitting there just in  emergency fund just because it really clicked with them it's like, hey, we can do this. So  that's what they decided to do.

506,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,172,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  So one of the things that I think is hard to understand or to explain to people is how  different the villages are. Like how you can have a village that's five miles away and why  is everything broken here and everything running here? So when you were working with  people and you're working with different villages, why did some villages take this and run  with it and be successful? And why did other ones not even want to talk to you? And why  did other ones talk to you, but not listen to you? What's the difference? ",58:08
507,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,172,11,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  That's a good question, I don't think there's a universal answer. There's a lot of, some  communities had really bad experience with whites and that played into it because there  was a couple that wouldn't even talk to me because of the color of my skin. Which was  kind of shocking at first, I was like, holy crap. But I got used to it after a while. I mean the  first time I was in [REDACTED], I walked into the village, would have been the council ",58:08
508,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,173,1,Interviewee ,"building, tribal council office, and a guy met me at the door and said, ""What do you want?  And why are you in my village?"" ",58:08
509,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,173,2,Interviewee ,"I was like, hi. Mind you, the office people knew I was coming, they knew who I was. Right.  So that was an interesting encounter. But it wasn't abnormal actually by that point. So I  think past experience had a lot to do with it. A lot of people came in with the idea that  they were teach them how to do something because their way of doing it was wrong, and  that puts a bad taste in anybody's mouth. So my attitude going into it was, hey, I have this  information and I can provide this for you, here's why, but at the end of the day, it's your  decision and I'm not going to get mad if you don't do my idea. ",58:08
510,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,173,3,Interviewee ,So that went a long ways and a lot. Other communities are just tremendously  dysfunctional and it goes back for years and years and years. ,58:08
511,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,173,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. So if you think about an individual community where things went well, how much  of that is the community being that way versus one person that you're working with? If  you lost one person in that village that was a key contact, would that make a difference  or would that- ",58:08
512,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,173,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  It made a difference [REDACTED] actually. I had a good administrator that was a really  good listener, he kind of got it, for lack of a better term. But he was under so much  pressure just because of dysfunction, dysfunctionality of everything. He didn't last very  long, unfortunately and then things started to deteriorate after that. But we had a good  utility clerk and we actually had a good water and sewer person. So, we kind of stalled  out on some of the administrative things, but we were doing really well as far as  understanding concepts. ",58:08
513,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,173,6,Interviewee ,"There wasn't anything on paper yet. Because first you have to understand the concept  before you can actually start to apply a lot of the information you've been given. Does  that make sense? But then [REDACTED] so the person that stepped in really didn't care,  they're just kind of there for a paycheck. So it took a pretty bad hit there. And then the  utility management, the individual water and sewer person, they had a lot of things going  on at home and then they lost support of these other two people so that after that we  just crashed. ",58:08
514,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,173,7,Interviewee ,"So, a lot of times there'll be two or three people on the council that'll push it, or they'll be  like a water and sewer clerk will work really good with the accounting, and they'll be like,  ""Okay, we need to make these changes."" And if you get enough of that long enough, you  end up actually turning the whole council to better understanding it, if that makes sense.  But it's a long process, it's unfortunate that it ended when it did because we were really  making some headway in some of the communities. ",58:08
515,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,173,8,Interviewee ,But without an understanding of the timeline and I mean just a generational way of doing  things out here … ,58:08
516,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,1,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  You mean people slow to accept change or kind of skeptical of new things or skeptical of  you? ,58:08
517,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Both. First they're very skeptical of me because, what do you want is the prevailing  attitude. Which I totally understand. I kind of see it. And a lot of your big corporations  come out that are grant funded and some of them leave the project half done. Or this  isn't done and that's not done and then they dump it on the council. So it took me a good  year before I got enough credibility. And then some of these communis are like, ""We don't  really understand what you're saying, but we think it's good idea so we're just going to do  it."" ",58:08
518,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,3,Interviewee ,"I'm like, wait a second. Okay we're going to go over this again because if something  happens to me, you have to know why you made the decision. And that was really  challenging. I did a lot of spreadsheets, did a lot of PowerPoints, really simplified things  because a business concept to somebody that is 50, 60 years old is not the same business  concept for somebody that's from the lower 48. Does that make sense? ",58:08
519,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,4,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Right. And I guess if you haven't grown up in a commercial autonomy or like a- ,58:08
520,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So one guy I talked to he's in his 70s, he remembers before there was currency they used  to buy stuff at the store with mink pellets. So currency and budgeting just is completely  foreign idea to him. ",58:08
521,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,6,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Right. ,58:08
522,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,7,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Much less your whole business management thing is just not … it's like what? ,58:08
523,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Right, right. Yeah. ",58:08
524,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,9,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  So it took quite a bit to get them to understand that whole concept. ,58:08
525,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,10,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Yeah I guess it's easy you to take that for granted when you grow up and no one ever  explained to me the concept of why you get a job to make money to buy the things you  want and why your boss pays you more for … you know what I mean? That's so automatic  if you grew up with it. ,58:08
526,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,11,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So for instance, a lot of the linear way of thinking is, I have this much money, I can buy  this. If I want this down the road, they don't bank that far ahead. ",58:08
527,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,12,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Did you work with operators at all? Like operator training? ,58:08
528,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,13,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Mm-hmm (affirmative). ,58:08
529,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,174,14,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  So was that part of this job or was that separate? ,58:08
530,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,1,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So I did operator training, not so much training valves but, how do we track what we do  in the plant? How do we track, how long did it take us to do this? Can we do it more  efficiently? I train them basically to, how do I word it? To do data entry essentially on a  very simplified spreadsheet that they would then … were able to provide to either me  early on or their manager, whether that be an accountant on some places, utility  management, something like that. ",58:08
531,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,2,Interviewee ,"And then oftentimes they would take the data from the operator, put that into a  spreadsheet that I formed. And we didn't want to leave them as a spreadsheet. The goal  was to always move them into a QuickBooks program so that this data went into a  QuickBooks program so that they had the ability to look back, okay, how much water did  we make last year? How much did it cost to make that water? ",58:08
532,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,3,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Or like how much chemicals did we use or? ,58:08
533,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,4,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Yep. ,58:08
534,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,5,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. ,58:08
535,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So like [inaudible]. Now like [REDACTED], their QuickBooks was nonfunctional at the time,  it was a real bad disaster. So [REDACTED] was actually able to partner with a accounting  firm out of [REDACTED], and they actually came out, worked with them, worked with their  books, went back, created a new QuickBooks file for them, came out and installed it so  they could actually run functionally on their QuickBooks. ",58:08
536,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Like an accounting group from [REDACTED] went to [REDACTED] to do that, that must  have been an interesting visit. Okay. ",58:08
537,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,8,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  It wasn't bad. [REDACTED] ,58:08
538,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  All right. I just think it, you know, oh, it was like a sitcom, you know, ",58:08
539,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  It could go bad. That one went really well. In fact, they ended up networking all three of  their computers. So when the clerk entered in a credit card payment, it would show up  on the bookkeeper, could go in and look at that. And then the administrator could go in  and pull down printouts. And our goal was, one sheet of paper for the council. Here's your  bottom line, that's it. They have questions, more than happy to provide more data. ",58:08
540,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,175,11,Interviewee ,"But what they had been doing previously was four or five pages of financial reports. And  it was just more than they could understand it, that's not the way. So the goal was not  just to give person information, but the goal was to give them good information in which  they can then make a solid decision, if that makes sense. So providing them with the  information was not the end goal, providing them the information in a usable format was  ultimately the end goal. And from that then they could make solid decisions for their  community. Did that makes sense? ",58:08
541,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,1,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Yeah. Yeah. And so it sounds like you're working with this on a bunch of different levels. I  mean a little bit like a water salesman or something. ,58:08
542,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah. And then some communities, it never stays like … some communities they're like,  ""Hey [REDACTED], on your next trip out can you help us put security cameras in?"" I'm like,  yep, sure can. I'll bring my tools out. Because their viewpoint of me was I'm not a water  and sewer guy, I never helped the community. Now that is not the way our linear thinking  works. But to their way of thinking, that was completely natural. So I ended up helping  change toilets, install a new one. I helped them purchase security cameras in a couple  places, I helped a couple people with their boilers over the years. ",58:08
543,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,3,Interviewee ,"But the end result was, some communities, they got together with the school district and  they ordered all their fuel off the barge, and it saved them like 14 grand in one year. So in  order for me to have the influence to help them understand the concepts and things, it  didn't just end with that. ",58:08
544,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Well, and it sounds like maybe that helped build some credibility or … ",58:08
545,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Oh yeah. There's a couple communities I still get emails from. Hey, which one should we  buy? Probably this one. ",58:08
546,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,6,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Yeah. Well that's- ,58:08
547,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,7,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  They don't need me- ,58:08
548,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,8,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  That's good. ,58:08
549,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  … There was three communities they didn't need me, they were making really good  decisions on their own so … but they were smart enough to understand that they were  limited on how much they knew, they were limited on their resource base so  consequently then they would check with me. Which was super smart. One community,  after we talked for a while, they actually got together with the city and the tribe actually  worked together, and they were able to secure, I don't know how many hundreds of  thousands of dollars for a road project that wouldn't have been possible if they hadn't  worked together. ",58:08
550,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,10,Interviewee ,"Which that was really cool, that was a lot of fun being part of that. And I didn't do a whole  lot. I helped explained some systems and, hey this is something you want to think about.  This is a good point. Here's the pros, here's the cons, that's kind of how it went. Because  at the end of the day I kept telling them, I said, at the end day, I'm going to go home. I'm  going to go to [REDACTED]. I got my piped water, that's where I live, I'm not making  decisions for your community. ",58:08
551,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,176,11,Interviewee ,I'm providing you with the information because you live here. And I think that spoke  volumes. I had no agenda. ,58:08
552,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,1,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Did you talk to community members ever too? ,58:08
553,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,2,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Rarely. We tried to do a couple meetings and that was a massive failure. ,58:08
554,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,3,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Really? How come? ,58:08
555,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah. It just wasn't something interesting, it wasn't something they were thinking about.  They had people come through as long as they can remember talking about water and  sewer stuff, and then they're gone. Then a few years later somebody else comes here and  talks about water, sewer stuff and then somebody else … and nobody really is around. So  on an individual basis, yeah I talked to them all the time. I got rides from the airport, a lot  of people in the community knew who I was. I got invited for coffee and dinner at people's  houses and stuff like that, and we would talk. But- ",58:08
556,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  So, were people … is it priority? I guess. ",58:08
557,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Uh-uh (negative). Because how they live is fine. It's really not any different than you or I.  So there's different ways to go up and shoot a moose, there's different ways to … my way  of doing it works just fine for me so you can provide me with a bunch of information. So  you're not going to turn a community's interpretation of fishing, hunting, water, and  sewer, you're not going to turn it. You need to communicate to the people that manage  that community, and through that then changes will take course. ",58:08
558,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. So it's interesting because you were basically working with communities that opted  in. So they must have seen some … had some priority, and then there's probably some  that didn't opt in and may never opt in, they don't ask for help because they not that  concerned about it. ",58:08
559,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So there was like [REDACTED], I actually probed them and said, will you work with me?  So those were three because they were so dysfunctional, they didn't know how bad they  were. And they're still dysfunctional to this day, I like to think less dysfunctional. But those  I did approach and I asked to work with, and we made good headway in all three of them. ",58:08
560,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Because you mentioned a couple things about limited knowledge and different cultural  aspects, and then just maybe, I don't know, a lack of interest, lack of prioritizing water. So  what were the major challenges for a place like [REDACTED]? Why were things not going  well? ",58:08
561,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,177,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  [REDACTED] historically has just been a disaster. Completely dysfunctional, income is  really low- ",58:08

574,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,178,11,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Just- ,58:08
575,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,178,12,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  A lot of them were out of the river. They had a water plant, so they had a water plant at  the time when I was there. A lot of people wouldn't drink it, it was good water, a lot of  people wouldn't drink it. Most of them drank from the river. They do river water. The  interesting thing about [REDACTED] is like I said, we made really good headways.  [REDACTED] recommended to be fired, and they had a stern talking to him and he turned  out really good. I did not expect that. I figured this guy's going to be a pain in my butt  forever. But, I mean he turned out to be really good. He really started listening and he  had that plant running like a million bucks. So it's a really depressed community too.  There's not a lot going on. Does that make sense? ",58:08
576,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,178,13,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. Yeah. Well I guess what I'm thinking about is, there's issues of sort of general  dysfunction, right? Like where just things don't function well. The school doesn't function  well, the council, they don't function well and then there's this other thing of water  infrastructure that might not be just a top priority. And so are those things together? Are  there examples of places that are pretty functional communities, have a good school, and  everything's great, but they're just not that interested in water, or do those usually go  together? ",58:08
577,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,1,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  I would say [REDACTED] was, they're functional. But water just wasn't, water and sewer  just wasn't really on the radar. ",58:08
578,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. Like so people aren't interested in paying a bunch of money for it, or they're not  going to change go out of their way to make this change that maybe we feel as important,  but they're fine with that. ",58:08
579,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, they're perfectly fine with it. Other communities like [REDACTED], they wanted  water and sewer, but they were so dysfunctional that they just couldn't get there.  Council's a disaster, just a disaster. ",58:08
580,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  It's so interesting and it's still amazing to me, but trying to explain other people how  different these villages are. Like how you said, [REDACTED] wants water and then  [REDACTED], meh. ",58:08
581,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  They wanted the pipe system. They weren't going to talk to anybody, wasn't going to give  them a pipe system. But until that was going to happen- ",58:08
582,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Right, right. And then that's like, if they're not doing the stuff that sets them up for, you  know- ",58:08
583,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  And most of them, I can honestly say, there wasn't very many that didn't want to do it.  Some of them wanted to do it and they got it, and other ones just, they knew it, they  wanted it, but they just couldn't quite understand how to make it work. So you have two  very conflicting ways of thought. You have the subsistence, what we do works just fine,  this is how we've been doing it for 1,000 years, for however long, why do we have to do  it your way? Why do we have to do it your way? And I ran into that a lot, and that's really  where you have to give them the option, and you have to just let it be that. ",58:08
584,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  So when things weren't working, when things broke and people didn't get their water,  what were the common … what kind of things did you see? ",58:08

586,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah, well like for whatever reason. I want to have water at my house and I don't … all of  the above. Was it because the water plant wasn't making water, or something frozen  broke? Was it because the house wasn't built with sinks? I don't know. ",58:08
587,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,11,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, all of it. All of it, yeah. Some communities would run out of water and that was  primarily a water plant issue. ",58:08
588,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,179,12,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Like a water plant issue with the physical water plant or water like the guy didn't make  enough water? ,58:08

591,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So thinking of an example. So I did notice a theme, for lack of a better term that, if a  community had piped water and that piped water stopped functioning, there was much  more frustration in that community. Because once they got piped water, they got used to  turning on the tap, they got used to the convenience, they wanted to keep that  convenience. ",58:08
592,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,3,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  I get that. ,58:08
593,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  That's kind of how we are. But, with the flush tank and haul, the small hauls, they ran out  of water, we'll melt some snow and we'll get some water tomorrow. It really just was like,  not that big of a deal. ",58:08
594,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,5,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  I get that. Did you see seasonal issues with interruptions in water service? ,58:08
595,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah. And that's just everywhere. If sometimes we would have a water plant operator  that would take off during kings, and then the sub would maybe not make enough water  or not do something right and break something, that was kind of a norm. The first cold  snap in some communities that the water plant operator wasn't up to snuff on, that was  usually the problem. And then in the spring when things started to warm up and we got  that good cold snap we usually get, drives the frost down farther, [inaudible]. ",58:08
596,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,7,Interviewee ,"So, house problems I didn't get into too much. One community I did work with them, they  actually decided to employ a guy to fix stuff in the homes, and then they would bill the  customers. ",58:08
597,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,8,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. ,58:08
598,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  That was really cool. That worked out really, really well. Really well. People in the  community really appreciated it, gave a guy a job and it was a little bit of income for the  utility. ",58:08
599,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  So this would be like if I had a plumbing problem in my house, and that's why water didn't  income to my sink because my faucet was broken or something. ",58:08
600,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,11,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah. So you would just call the city, because trying to find a plumber, electrician out here  is nearly impossible in [REDACTED], they're just nonexistent in the villages. ",58:08
601,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,12,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Well it probably wasn't a plumber in the village, right? ",58:08
602,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,180,13,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Oh he was good. Actually he was a plumber. ,58:08

608,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Well I think he was certified, not bonded and insured definitely but he had worked on a  couple of projects so he knew the plumbing and the houses fairly well. ",58:08
609,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  It's always easy to find a handyman, it's hard to find a actual electrician or a trades man. ",58:08
610,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Actually, I talked to him and I recommended it to hire him. He was a good guy. That was  pretty cool. ",58:08
611,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,8,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  That's a good deal. Usually- ,58:08
612,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  And that really tied … so that the council providing essentially a support person to the  community members, that really went over big. That tied a lot of the community  members back to the council in a positive way. ",58:08
613,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,10,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Yeah. That's neat. ,58:08
614,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,11,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  That was pretty cool. ,58:08
615,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,12,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Usually when I ask about seasonal things, we just talk about like, in the winter things  freeze and break. So it's interesting to think about subsistence and people, the human  side, the human people just taken off. ",58:08
616,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,13,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, we would see that pretty regularly. So I have one community that they made water  like crazy until moose season and then they were gone. The water ran itself. Sometimes  it did, sometimes it didn't. ",58:08
617,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,14,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  So that's kind of the next question, it's interesting to think about climate change. This is  we think about like okay, there are rains for a week in January, but then also that might  affect subsistence stuff too. With what you were doing, working with people, has change  in climate over time, did you see any effect of that or? ",58:08
618,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,15,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  You hear a lot of talk about it, but I didn't see any of it. I didn't ever see any of it. We had  the coldest November we've ever had this year. It was cold. We had a ton of snow last  year. So you hear less people talk about climate change this year than they did three years  ago when it rained. ",58:08
619,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,181,16,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. Well, had some rain January. ",58:08

622,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,3,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  So I don't think too much of it. ,58:08
623,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Let's see. So, in general, over time if we're talking about water infrastructure delivery, has  that been getting better or worse, or the same? ",58:08
624,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  I mean, the pipe systems are better than they used to be. I would say they made some  significant improvements in the pipe systems. Some of the old ones are pretty crappy.  Flush tank and haul, small haul systems are really unchanged, there's just only so much  you can do. ",58:08
625,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,6,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Are there new pipe systems going in? ,58:08
626,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  [REDACTED] got one here a couple years ago, [REDACTED] just went online, not last year,  I think a couple years ago. There's an article on that. ",58:08
627,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  So in your experience, then things have improved from where they were five, 10 years  ago? ",58:08
628,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, I would say. Unfortunately the system's a little bit broken in that if [REDACTED] and  [REDACTED] are both honey bucket. So you have a place that small haul like [REDACTED],  they don't want to put a pipe system in. Which if you really want to affect change out  here and you really want people to be healthier, the pipe system is the way to go. The  flush tank and haul, people don't use more water. We've been over that 1,000 times. ",58:08
629,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. What about, so from your expertise, what about from a cost perspective? If you're  a consumer what does it cost comparatively? ",58:08
630,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,11,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Well, I mean takes millions and millions of dollars to put a pipe system in. And it's  probably, it's more expensive from a consumer standpoint to have a pipe system. You  have to charge more for the water, but you also have a limit to it. So it's harder to put a  price tag on the health in communities. ",58:08
631,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,12,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  So the pipe systems aren't metering at all? ,58:08
632,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,13,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  No. ,58:08
633,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,14,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. So you just get pipe goes to your house and it's just go nuts? Okay. ,58:08
634,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,182,15,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah. So they tried the metering systems, that's a giant pain. It just doesn't work. Because  you're talking about paying somebody and putting in, it's just a ton more work, more data ",58:08
635,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,1,Interviewee ,"entry, we found is communities just aren't doing it. Like screw that. We'll just do a flat  rate. ",58:08
636,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,2,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Yeah. Do you know like [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] what the flat rate is? ,58:08
637,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,3,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  [REDACTED] doesn't do a rate because they're flush tank and haul. ,58:08
638,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,4,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. ,58:08
639,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Flush tank and haul don't do them. I don't remember what [REDACTED] was right off the  top of my head, I had that information all buried somewhere. So, [REDACTED] is a little  bit different. So [REDACTED] is really a community that's divided [REDACTED]. So  [REDACTED] is actually flush tank and haul and [REDACTED] pipe, which is super dumb.  They're only like [REDACTED] miles apart, they run pipe a lot farther than [REDACTED]  miles other parts [REDACTED]. But this is one of those things where they didn't do the  funding right, or they spent the money where they shouldn't have and yet half a  community- ",58:08
640,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,6,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Are they across the river though? ,58:08
641,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,7,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Mm-hmm (affirmative). ,58:08
642,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,8,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  So they could run a pipe. ,58:08
643,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,9,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  They do in [REDACTED]. ,58:08
644,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,10,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Really? ,58:08
645,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,11,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah. So they horizontal board right under the river, right under [REDACTED]. So there's  a water line that runs over to a watering point on the other side of the river. That's crazy.  And there's a lagoon over there. So it's- ",58:08
646,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,12,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  I guess, yeah. ",58:08
647,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,13,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  And [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are less than five miles apart. So that's a frustration in  that community. But what they did do and they were smart about, they did flat rate on  flush tank at home. So once a week you get to fill up and you get an evac on your sewer.  Doesn't matter what's in there, doesn't matter … and then they get billed, at that time it  was 90 bucks a month for once a week. And then if you want another fill out or another  evac, it's like 15 bucks or something. ",58:08
648,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,14,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Oh wow. That sounds pretty cheap to me, I guess. ",58:08
649,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,183,15,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Well, yeah. And they have to do it all by four-wheeler. There's only like [REDACTED]  something homes over there, so it's- ",58:08

651,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Well the tank is 100 gallons and your house is 100 gallons. So I would say on average  between 60 and 80 gallons, pretty rare you run it all the way out in a situation like that. ",58:08
652,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. So, okay. So it'd be like $90, so it should be about a dollar, a gallon and then … ",58:08
653,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Something like that. And I want to say, it usually runs, I got one or two stuck in my head  so a $1.02 I think was an average over the course of a year to fill the water. ",58:08

655,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Oh yeah, don't put the chemical in. So [REDACTED] they all make really good water. The  water quality depends on whether they maintain the water system. That's really where it  comes down to. They don't buy the chemicals, they don't fix the pipes. If they don't do  their maintenance, you get crappy water. ",58:08
656,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. Like crappy in the sense of like EPA letter, or just doesn't taste good? ",58:08
657,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Pink, not enough chlorine so it stinks real bad. Smells like chlorine because you get the  chloramine, I think they call it. ",58:08

662,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,13,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. ,58:08
663,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,14,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So they put too much monochloramine, doesn't hurt you just make your water look kind  of pink, stuff like that. ",58:08
664,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,15,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. Well so, I guess pivoting a little bit and talking more about people that you worked  with on the administrative side, it sounds like it's not always folks that had an  administrative degree or a background. They just- ",58:08
665,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,184,16,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Pretty rare, yeah. There's no degrees in the village. So some of them had administrative  experience, like there was a couple people that lived in [REDACTED] for a couple years  and then moved back to the village. But most of them just have leadership qualities and  then some pf them just are natural leaders. So that helped quite a bit. Other ones are  better. I worked with some that are really good with math, so that kind of clicked with ",58:08

667,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Well and that's kind of one of our questions. And it sounds like you did a little bit of  education. So, would that help? Would that be a resource that would help to go out there  and try to teach? ",58:08
668,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,3,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  No. ,58:08
669,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,4,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. ,58:08
670,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,5,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Don't do that please. ,58:08
671,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,6,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. What's the best way to make people better at … to get things to click? ,58:08
672,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  I mean education is the answer, but the way you educate is not how you do it in the lower  48. ",58:08
673,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,8,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  How would you do it? ,58:08
674,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  First you have to get to know, out here you have to get to know them. And then you have  to be able to identify their strength and weaknesses, as well as their interests. ",58:08
675,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  When you say they you mean the individuals, you mean the community or the- ",58:08
676,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,11,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  The individuals you're trying to … because to educate a community is foolish out here. If  you want to educate and you want to change the direction of a community, first you  educate and change the thinking direction of the council. And that's only done over  extensive amounts of time and relationship. A lot of my council meetings were half  business, half storytelling, half house of fish. [REDACTED] ",58:08
677,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,12,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  How about operators? So got operators all over the board? ,58:08
678,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,13,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah. Some of them they take a ton of pride in what they do, do not jack with their system,  just you got to work with how they do it, period. That's just the way it's going to be. I got  one guy down at [REDACTED] and he was good, holy smokes he was good. I don't think  he went to school more than like past eighth grade, but he could operate that plant like  nobody's business. And it didn't break, you never had to go to [REDACTED] to fix stuff.  You never had water quality issues. A big corporation came in, built a new plant, ",58:08
679,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,185,14,Interviewee ,"didn't consult him in any way, shape or form, put a bunch of automated stuff in, and it  just went to crap. It was terrible. I don't even think he's still there anymore, he got so  frustrated and they've had nothing but problems with plant operations. And then other  operators were really good. They're like, ""Oh I get this. I can write this down, this down,  this down, no problem, man."" And then just turn it in. ",58:08
680,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,186,1,Interviewee ,"So, I mean from one spectrum to the other, education wise though, very little. ",58:08

684,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,186,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah because it's pointless. It really, to be honest with you, it completely is. So I'm  certified to run a level one plant, that's insane, man, you don't want me running your  plant. I can figure it out, but you have other guys that can run their plant and they can  hardly pass one test. Part of it is, it's a thought process thing, part of it is testing isn't a big  thing in the village. It's not. A lot of them don't have driver's licenses because where  you're going to drive? They don't take tests. ",58:08
685,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,186,6,Interviewee ,"And there's a language barrier, that's pretty significant. A lot of your operators are 45 and  older. So a lot of them, English is a second language if that. So when you're trying to  explain concepts on a piece of paper through a language that's second, they're really  challenged with it. I think it's a terrible idea, it's a poor indication of intelligence, and I  just, I think it's a waste of time. ",58:08
686,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,186,7,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  What would be better? ,58:08
687,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,186,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  I think somebody that would certify them to run their plant. So the operator certification,  it talks about concepts that most of these guys have never even heard of. It goes into stuff  like fluoride, most of them aren't putting fluoride in, because it wants … so it certified  them across the whole state for all kinds of stuff. Divide it up, certify them for  [REDACTED], or certify them for this plant, this plant and this plant. ",58:08
688,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,186,9,Interviewee ,"It's not the answer for the whole state, but it's the answer for out here. I've noticed a  significant difference when you get [REDACTED] business concepts, English as a language,  all of that stuff's been there a lot longer. The concepts are a lot more readily understood,  if that's a term. So out here is just really unique, super unique. In fact, even, I don't know  if this even applies but, the coast guard even recognized that [REDACTED] is different, and  the fact that you can get a six pack license just for rivers in [REDACTED] versus a six pack  for the rest of the nation. So- ",58:08

696,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,187,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, a lot of guys did it. It's a test that identifies that this is different out here, and this is  what applies to out here, it doesn't apply to the rest of the world. So that would be like,  you have a guy that's certified, like one of our RMWs, he goes out, talks to the guy, come  up with some sort of questionnaire or whatever, whatever, you know what. But yeah.

708,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,187,16,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. It seemed like the feeling is that the pass rates were better, but that you're also  selecting for people who could get online. So that might be part of the- ",58:08
709,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,187,17,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  There is that- ,58:08
710,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,1,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  You're taking the chunk of people that are the most savvy kind of, so that was sort of that  thing. ",58:08
711,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah that's cool. I just kind of … Yeah. So that was a big thing. so back to QuickBooks  bookkeeping things, we had experimented a little bit with online education, online  training for QuickBooks stuff and online QuickBooks. Holy crap. That was awful,  absolutely awful. There was more frustration than that than I could handle. So what  would happen is, bookkeepers that really knew their stuff they would try to do what they  needed to do, and they couldn't get the internet speeds they needed, so they couldn't get  their stuff done. So they really cared, they really wanted to do it, but they couldn't get it  done. ",58:08
712,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,3,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Like to do the online training you mean? Because you wouldn't- ,58:08
713,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,4,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Online training or QuickBooks online. ,58:08
714,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,5,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. ,58:08
715,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So that was a big push that [REDACTED] was recommended to try and get everybody  online so that when they needed accounting assistance, the accountant from [REDACTED]  or wherever, could go online and do it. Epic failure. I just finally cut that one sitting on it.  That's ridiculous. ",58:08
716,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,7,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  And people then just did it offline. ,58:08
717,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,8,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Yeah. So they went with- ,58:08
718,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,9,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Spreadsheet or something. ,58:08
719,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,10,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  No they went with the QuickBooks version that's on your computer. ,58:08
720,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,11,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Yeah. Okay. ,58:08
721,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,12,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  They went that route. We just couldn't get to work. Or they would work when school is  out. ,58:08
722,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,13,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Right, right. ",58:08
723,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,14,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  You got a bucket worth of internet, and the more slices out of the bucket, you got to go- ",58:08
724,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,15,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah, you got to train them to get on there at 2:00 in the morning or- ",58:08
725,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,16,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  It's crazy. ,58:08
726,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,188,17,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Up at 4:00 AM, get your QuickBooks done. ",58:08
727,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,1,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Yeah. We abandoned that really quick. So any type of training you're trying to do … yeah  I don't think that- ,58:08
728,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,2,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  How did you train people to do QuickBooks then? I mean you got to go stand over their  shoulder and show them or? ,58:08
729,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,3,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  A lot of them I did. ,58:08
730,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,4,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Yeah. Okay. ,58:08
731,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  A lot of time spent to do basic concepts. A lot of it comes with anything new, they just  didn't have much confidence. Even if they knew it, they just didn't have a lot of  confidence. So there was a lot of confidence building like, hey, you got this. That type of  thing. Most of the QuickBooks training I actually got ahold of somebody else to help with  that. Because I don't have that type of background. Really my specialty was  communication and introducing new concepts to the community. That's really where/ the  other stuff I had to partner with somebody. Because the guys that I talked to that were  super good at books, they could not function in the village setting at all. They couldn't  wrap their mind around non-linear thinking. And I just … so- ",58:08
732,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,6,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  We have that at [REDACTED] too. ,58:08
733,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah. Yeah. Some people just can't talk to other normal people, that's okay. ",58:08
734,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  But I read the book on cultural competency, tell me what's the problem. ",58:08
735,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, bring your book, you really have to use to make a fire here. But those  people were really, really good in what they did so it wasn't like they weren't it worth  anything, but it required a partnership in order to make that communication effective  enough that that person could then take the information from the expert, and apply it  directly to the system in which they worked. If that makes sense. ",58:08
736,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. The actual on the ground stuff. ",58:08
737,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,11,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Yeah. ,58:08
738,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,12,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  So for operator training, operators came in, they got training, how much of that was for  passing a test and how much of that was, I mean because you're saying the test maybe  wasn't that useful, how much of it was set for actually running their plant? What was the  value in the training when they came in? ",58:08
739,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,13,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  I think it was to get a paper certification. ,58:08
740,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,189,14,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  That's what the training was aimed at? ,58:08
741,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,1,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  That's what it was. ,58:08
742,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,2,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Okay. It wasn't like this will help you when you go home? ,58:08
743,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Very little of it will help them when they get home because there's a lot covered in that  test, and only small sections of it would apply to their … we found the same thing with  training for clerks, administrators and things like that. You can't bring them out and give  them a generic training, you need to train them on their specific system because each  system is different. So [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] run their books different ways.  There's different ways to do QuickBooks, there's different ways to enter things. ",58:08
744,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,4,Interviewee ,"Everybody enters them a little bit different. It doesn't make them wrong, it just makes it  different. So you can't take somebody from [REDACTED], from [REDACTED], from where?  [REDACTED] and then somebody from the coast like out on [REDACTED], put them in a  room and run them through a train, and have it be effective for all of them. Which was a  current pattern before COVID. I went to one of those trainings and I met people from  [REDACTED], all the way out to [inaudible]. It was insane. Insane. ",58:08
745,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,5,Interviewee ,"And I came away with it going, I would never come to one of these ever again. It's not a  concept we use anywhere else except here. So if you want to learn to fix your motorcycle,  I've got a training on cars, you need to come and do cars because it talks a little bit about  internal commotion engines, that makes no sense. But yet we use it out here all the time.  Super damn. So- ",58:08
746,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,6,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  And is that just because we're trying to get people to pass their tests? Or is it just … ,58:08
747,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,7,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Mostly. ,58:08
748,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,8,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  So why do we care if people pass their tests or not? ,58:08
749,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Because if you have a certain amount of certifications, then some of that is tied to funding.  Which is, I understand that certifications are important, that you're certified to  understand something and again, [REDACTED] that probably actually does apply. I've  never taken any of that. But out here, everything is so different. It just doesn't work out  here. ",58:08
750,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. So then you have a community that can't get funding because they don't have a  certified operator, and then because they can't get funding they can't improve things,  make the plan easier to operate or kind of a- ",58:08
751,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,11,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Yep. That's exactly- ,58:08
752,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,12,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  … kind of in the toilet there. ,58:08
753,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,190,13,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  Yeah. ,58:08
754,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,1,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Can't climb out of that. ,58:08
755,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Or if their QuickBooks is a mess and they really want to fix it, but they simply don't have  the power to fix it and they go to this training, but it's not on their QuickBooks, it's not on  fixing their mess, that's the point. ",58:08
756,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Right, right, right. Yeah. ",58:08
757,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  I always thought funding would be better spent actually hiring an actual accounting firm  to come out and just redo their entire QuickBooks set up, start from scratch, however  that's done. And then have like four days where you just go through their books and you  set it up. You sit right next to each other, you set it up for like two days, and then there's  two days where you're sitting next to them and they're doing the data entry. And then  from there, then they have a direct line to this entity. ",58:08
758,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Would turnover affect that? So you come out, you do four days, this person, and then  they move [REDACTED] or they move to [REDACTED] or whatever, are you starting over  or would that have lasting … ",58:08
759,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Well, that's going to depend on how you roll it out. That's going to really depend on how  you roll it out. And it won't work for every community. It's going to be a community that  really wants it and has proved that they moved in direction. So if you have the utility  management, it's kind of the first bridge. So you get understanding some concepts, you  get them thinking, headed in the right direction, and then where your expertise in that  ends, that's where this community is. ",58:08
760,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,7,Interviewee ,"That's where you would have an entity that partners with utility management. Come out,  do the training and things, and that utility management individual, excuse me, is there  along with that entire time. So then they have a knowledge on how that system is set up.  Does that make sense? And then your turnover it'll affect it, it always does. But it'll  minimize it. ",58:08
761,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Right, if there's like a system. ",58:08
762,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  There's a system in place and then the community, when I say community, I mean the  governing entity of that community, understands how important this is. They're going to  want that to be straightened out. And I've seen it, again, [REDACTED], they got their credit  together. Is there areas of improvement? Of course there always is. But they, excuse me,  they bought it and they run it themselves now. They're getting, [REDACTED], they're filing  for grants, they're getting grant funding for stuff. ",58:08
763,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,191,10,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Kind of success builds on success. ,58:08
764,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,1,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  It really does. Once they get a little bit of confidence, they understand the concept, they  understand its importance on how it affects their community, they take ownership of it.  Once they see like, hey, this really makes a difference, then they just run with it. ",58:08
765,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Yeah. Well that's a real common question right on the first page of when the grant  application is, have you successfully administered grants before? And so if you're  successful that keeps trending up, and it's hard to dig your way out of the toilet if you're- ",58:08
766,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Some communities I heard they had a grant writer and I was just like, that's a terrible idea.  So I talked to them for like a year about getting rid of the grant writer position, taking  those funds and actually hiring somebody to apply for the specific grants that they  wanted, excuse me, that went over great. They started getting grants, started like, oh,  this is way easier. ",58:08
767,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,4,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  So then the grant writer had just been keeping an eye on for any grants that they could  get or? ,58:08
768,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,5,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  They were. That's what they were told at one time was, just apply for as many grants as  you can. So a lot of the way things are is because somebody told them that's the way to  do it at one time. And when somebody from the outside comes in and says something,  there is a ton of weight in certain communities. Again, honestly I think they've been made  to feel kind of dumb over the years. Like I started telling communities, hey, when  somebody walks into your village, ask why they're there. This is your home, this is your  house, you have that right. ",58:08
769,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,6,Interviewee ,"And they didn't realize that before. Now a lot of them are doing it so like, now when  people come … I got one community that's like, when somebody calls to see if they can  come out they're like, ""I don't know, what exactly do you want to talk to us about? We're  really busy. We have a lot of stuff to cover."" And they do because they got their crap  together. So where people used to be able to just show up and say whatever they want,  no man. So that was really good to see. ",58:08
770,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,7,Interviewee ,"And I practiced that. I'm like, ""Hey, I'd like to come out to this next meeting, this is what  we want to talk about. This is kind of what I'd like to say, this is about how long it's going  to take."" They're like, ""Yeah, we can fix you in on that."" Where when I first started coming  out there, nobody cared. You could just show up and I'm like, oh wait a minute, this has  got to change. You guys own this. ",58:08
771,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,8,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  If you could wave a wand and fix something in [REDACTED], what's your priority? What's  your thing? ",58:08
772,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,9,Interviewee ,Interviewee:  I'd fix education in a heartbeat. ,58:08
773,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,192,10,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  When you say education, you mean like the school system or you mean like education  around operator training or? ",58:08
774,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,193,1,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So it starts in the school system, but I would change the way education is done to  governing entities within, within [REDACTED]. Because then in turn they're going to  change the way their school's run, if that makes sense. ",58:08
775,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,193,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Okay. So that would be like training adults. That would be like, yeah, so you're a tribal  administrator or you're a council member. ",58:08
776,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,193,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  And change it to the mindset of, I want to train you and give you the support and the  education you need to change your community. I don't want to change your community;  I want to introduce concepts to you that allow you to make the decisions to change your  community if you so choose. I think that would revolutionize the way things are out here ",58:08
777,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,193,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewer:  Is that a money problem or is that … if you had $1 million, or if you had $10 million, would  that address that problem or there's something else? ",58:08

779,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,193,6,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  You mean on the educator side or on the … ,58:08
780,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,193,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  It's all on the educator side. So, and I'm not super smart, I don't have degrees or anything  really. So, take it with a grain of salt. But, I always thought, my understanding was, if I  have a concept that I wanted to introduce to you, it's my responsibility to introduce that  concept to you in a format that you can observe. That's not the way we go to college, it's  not how [inaudible]. And that's fine, but that's college, that's not here. Does that make  sense? ",58:08

785,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,193,12,Interviewee ,Interviewer:  Right. And go to college. ,58:08
786,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 11 ,193,13,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  So when you step into their home, which is exactly what you're doing, you have to have  a heart to empower them to change their own community, if that makes sense. And if  that's really not your heart, if that's not what you're willing to do, then it's probably not  the right position for you. Because if you want to talk about health, if I want the  community to be healthier, it starts with introducing concepts that will make that happen. ",58:08

817,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,196,15,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  There was no DMV open at the time, so basically, I called up [REDACTED] and they sent  me the test via mail, and I just took all the written tests. Back then, they had two different  types of CDLs. They had a commercial vehicle license for on-road systems, meaning  interstate, and off-road systems, which was being in isolated locations. [REDACTED], only  way in and out is by plane or by boat, so that would consider under being an off-road  system so you could drive commercially off-road system. But, it was about 10-15 years  ago they switched all to: you had to have interstate, so just one type of CDL. ",58:08

822,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,197,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  I still would have. I had a baby at the time, and working for the city was one of the higher- paying jobs. It wasn't paying much. When I started there, I was making $14.10 an hour as  to, when I was working at the airlines, I was working at [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I  worked two jobs at the time. And, as soon I found out [REDACTED], I was working two  jobs. I'd go to work at [REDACTED] at 7:00 in the morning. I'd get off work, go straight  over to [REDACTED], work until like 5:00 in the morning, go home, sleep for an hour, hour- and-a-half and start my day all over again. I'd seen that city of [REDACTED] was always  looking for drivers. They have a high turnover rate for drivers, so I went and got my CDL  and I applied for a job and got the job. ",58:08
823,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,197,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewer 1: So, how much would you say of your training to do that was from getting your CDL, like ",58:08
824,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,197,5,Interviewee ,"official training, and how much of it was on-the-job training where they taught you what  to do? ",58:08
825,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,197,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Pretty much everything, all on-the-job training. [REDACTED] was the one that trained me,  him and another guy that passed away. [REDACTED]. He passed away, but those were a  few guys that basically taught me how to drive heavy big trucks. All the water and sewer  trucks are all automatic, so it was pretty easy. ",58:08
826,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,197,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewer 1: And then, you went and you drove, so at some point, you had to get an interstate CDL. ",58:08

I got pulled over for a routine checkup, what they do on the interstate. They actually  arrested me, said I was driving illegally. I was like, ""What do you mean? I have my CDL.""  They said, ""No, you have an off-road system CDL. You're going to have to get an on-road  system CDL."" So, I had to park the truck right there where it was at. They didn't arrest  arrest me. They just, they give somebody time to go take the test, the driven test in order  to have your on-road system CDL. So immediately, like two days later, my work, the  [REDACTED] company I was working for had somebody drive me over to… We made an  appointment and went to the DMV. I took a road test with the [REDACTED] truck and got  my Class B. Later on, I ended up renting a truck to pull doubles and triples so I could get  my Class A rating. ",58:08

829,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,197,10,Interviewee ,think having that steppingstone of an off-road license would be helpful if that existed  today still versus people having to jump all the way up to the interstate? ,58:08
830,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,197,11,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Well, it was helpful being out in the village. Well, [REDACTED] a village or city, but, what  defines a village is only access by boat or by plane. There's no road system that drives to  [REDACTED], so, technically, it's a village, but it's a city. But yeah, it was really beneficial.  Almost all the drivers back in the '80s and '90s were off-road system CDL drivers. ",58:08
831,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,198,1,Interviewee ,"Interviewer 1: Do you have a sense of why that went away, why that option went away? ",58:08
832,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,198,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Just the state making it, instead of having difficulty between going back and forth  between an on-road system to off-road system, they just opted to get rid of the off-road  system and just had all on-road system. So, in order for you to have your CDL, besides  [REDACTED], prior to that, you had to come to [REDACTED]. You could take all the written  tests, but then you'd have to come to [REDACTED], rent the truck in order to get your on- road system CDL. ",58:08

The city was a lot  smaller back in the '90s before they started. They just started building up [REDACTED]  subdivision and making it a little bit larger. We did [REDACTED]. Before that, it got all  piped, so we had to. We had deliveries, water deliveries out to there. And, we only had  one pump house where we'd get our water from. Generally, we had four or five water  truck drivers and four sewer truck drivers, one garbage truck driver during the day. Water  truck drivers, they'd average four to five loads, you know, 3,500 gallons of water delivery  a day. The sewer truck drivers, sewer truck is a lot faster. They'd do like eight or nine loads  a day pumping out the holding tanks. Then, the garbage truck driver, he just went around,  did all the garbage dumpsters all throughout the city. ",58:08

845,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,199,1,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Oh, yeah, I had a lot of interaction with every. It's a small town. You get to know  everybody, you know? A lot of people are really happy to get their water. Some people  complain. Being a driver, we're constantly. On average, the trucks, a driver delivered to  40-50 houses a day, so that's 40-50 driveways that we're backing into, going into every  single day. We're constantly going up and down the truck stairs. You lose a lot of weight  doing that job just constantly getting in and out and dragging hose from house to house  to house. ",58:08
846,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,199,2,Interviewee ,"Also, being city water truck drivers, we were automatically put into the volunteer fire  department. So, when there was a house fire, all of us, in the middle of the night, us truck  drivers, we'd get calls from whoever our foreman was, or we'd get calls directly from the  fire department, and we'd go get our water trucks and go meet up with the fire  department for the house. They'd usually set up a swimming pool and we'd just dump all  the water so they can suck in and fight the fire, the house fire. ",58:08

I was the number one guy they'd call right off the bat when there was a fire. I lived on  [REDACTED], so it was close by. I'd be there at [REDACTED] within three, four minutes. I'd  go in there and I'd start up all the water trucks and do all the pre-checks, get them ready.  Sometimes, I'd park them outside and just leave them running for when the drivers got  in. They'd hop in the truck and go over to where the fire was. ",58:08

I remember seeing the sewer truck, and it was basically  a flatbed truck with the tank in the back. People would crawl in and out carrying five- gallon buckets for the sewer. The water truck, I think they only had one or two water  trucks. Actually, [REDACTED], probably still have a 300-gallon water tank inside the  ceiling. ",58:08

856,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,199,12,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, when you pull up to a house and they have a vehicle parked in their driveway, or  we can't. It made our job a whole lot easier for vehicles over 10 feet to just where we had ",58:08
857,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,200,1,Interviewee ,"space, because we were dragging hose or fighting dragging. You worked volunteer fire  department. You know how heavy those hoses get, dragging around obstacles and putting  on. We're doing that for 40-50 houses a day, so, interaction was. Most people, they're  always happy to see us like, ""All right, I'm getting my water! I just used up the last of my  water doing our laundry last night,"" so, majority of people are pretty happy to see us. But,  some people, they forget and they leave a vehicle parked, and we write them a tag and  have to go back later on and make sure that they've got their water. ",58:08

860,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,200,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, when I came back, it was a little bit more difficult. They piped all [REDACTED], which  made it a little bit easier. But then, they got [REDACTED] and more houses out in  [REDACTED], and that's a lot further away from the pump houses, so there's a lot more  drive time. A lot of the trucks now, newer trucks, they've got the DEF fluid they have to  regenerate, so there's a lot of downtime where, every couple of days, your truck would  have to sit there for an hour and regen, clear out all that exhaust. That just made it harder.  Back in the old days, it seemed like the trucks pump a little bit faster, too. We'd pump  100-120 gallons a minute. The new trucks, they'd only pump 70-90 gallons a minute, so  the water fill was a lot slower. It'd take a lot longer filling up a house. On average now,  the trucks are only doing maybe four loads. I used to do five loads in an eight-hour day,  same size tank, 3,500 gallon tank with the water trucks. ",58:08
861,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,200,5,Interviewee ,Interviewer 1: Do you think that's an issue with the pumps going slower or the houses having bigger ,58:08

863,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,200,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Well, it's a combination of both. But, having it pump slower, you're spending, at a 1,500- gallon tank where it used to only take us 15 minutes, you minus off 10 gallons of minute,  every 10 minutes is an extra minute. All those little one-minute extras, or a minute-and- a-half, all that adds up towards the end of the day. It's just a big snowball because, the  slower you're taking to fill up a house, the more people are using their water, so it's  another snowball effect because you're slower filling up this house, slower filling up this  house, this house and this house. By the time you get to the end of the houses, they'd  used an extra 100 gallons, 200 gallons more of their water, so we're spending a lot more  time doing that. ",58:08
864,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,200,8,Interviewee ,"When I'd gone back, for slower trucks, slower pumping trucks and slower. The regenning  and just having to drive further, a lot of drivers, we're not getting done in eight hours.  They're constantly going in and out, so you're getting hot and cold, hot and cold, hot and  cold. You're more susceptible to be getting sick because, you get inside the truck, you  start sweating. You go outside, you get cold. You get chilled, and all that plays into factor.  So, we'd have drivers that get sick, and you'd have to take time off to rest up. It's a very  hard job. ",58:08

How many years was that, like [REDACTED] years? They were still  driving the same trucks from when I left, and those were constantly breaking down. There  were a few times where trucks, they only had like three water trucks. So, what the city  was doing was they'd have drivers doing double shift. They'd have one driver.

The old truck I used to drive, [REDACTED], it was one of the  older trucks, and it didn't have too much insulation in the cab. By the end of the day, I'd  be literally covered head to toe in ice just from getting sprayed and whatnot. I had two  sets of arctic gear, so I'd use one set one day. It'd be totally frozen, iced up.

I train drivers and I've had  them quit within a week just because it was like, ""Oh, this is too tough. This is not enough  pay for the hard work."" I've had other drivers that just weren't meant to be drivers. I was  a trainer for like [REDACTED] years. I'd pretty much train all the new drivers.

Well, I don't know the full budget but, because  of lack of drivers and all, they pay more out in overtime than they do in regular time,  which kind of worked out great for me. I'd go out there.

That helped out quite  a bit, too, not having to drive nearly as far going out to [REDACTED] and out to  [REDACTED]. That helped out quite a bit. I was good friends with [REDACTED] at  [REDACTED]. He's been there, [REDACTED] He'd sit there. We'd have time, downtime, fill  up the trucks and they'd talk to [REDACTED]. They'd say, ""Our pump house can't exactly  keep up with the water of [REDACTED],"" because [REDACTED] was growing. Then, they  built that [REDACTED]holding tank, so, during the evening time when there was less water  usage, they'd have that time to fill up that million-gallon tank to try to subsidize for the  usage of water. When they did [REDACTED], that helped out a lot, having more quality  water, I should say, cleaner water because it takes time to filter out all the impurities of  water. They've got big filters in there. They've got to backwash them consistently, clean  them out just so they could have good, viable, up-to-spec drinking water. ",58:08

The water  quality was good even though it was all the hardships and challenges that they faced.  After [REDACTED] had retired, they'd got another guy in there and he did it completely  different. Of course, the pipes being 40-50 years old, what he did different was heating  up the waters and sending it out through the pipes instead of heating it up inside the  building and letting it chance to cool off before sending it out the pipes.

It gets air bubbles inside of it, and those air bubbles. What's the main metal?  What's metal's most nemesis? Air and rust. It causes rust inside the pipes. So, for a while  there, for a few years there, people's water boilers and their holding tanks and whatnot  start filling up with rust because of the pipes that were on the pipe water and sewer.

If we had a blizzard  and I had a holding tank and water truck was not able to get to my water fill because of  the snow pileup or just not be able because of road conditions. I'd be without water for a  couple of days. I'd rather be on a pipe system just for reliability. There's a lot of factors  with getting your water than just driving. ,58:08

If you go and drive through  [REDACTED], you'll see some of the pipes, you know, the frost heaves and putting these  pipes way high up in the air. That's part of the problem, but just having pipes going all  throughout the city, the permafrost and everything in the ground. Most places  throughout everywhere else, they have the pipes underground. [REDACTED], being kind  of unique in that aspect is having the pipes above ground. So, just imagine the cost of  running pipes all the way out to [REDACTED], having to have those pipes. Not only that.  People, during the wintertime, they're traveling a lot with snow machines, so, getting out,  going over pipes. They did build a lot of ramps over high traffic areas, but accidents do  happen. People run into the pipes. I've seen trucks that run into pipes and start spraying  and whatnot. ",58:08

Now, the climate change is warm and cold, warm  and cold, warm and cold, so the roads get a lot slicker. Back in the '90s and early 2000s, it  was a lot colder, so we wouldn't have that fluctuation in the warm and cold, warm and  cold to where everything just turned to an ice rink. It would happen from time to time,  but not nearly as much as it does now. I could recall sometimes where it got really warm;  everything melted and froze up at night and just turned into polished ice. We're just  wearing out tire chains like crazy, everybody having to use ice cleats. ",58:08

I just took a stud gun from the tire shop and put a  bunch of studs in my boots just so I could have constant traction because it would wear  out ice cleats. Getting in and out of the truck with ice cleats, they'd always get stuck on  the stairs, so you always had a tripping hazard. There's a lot of challenges that a lot of  people don't see with driving a water sewer truck, just constantly getting in and out of  the truck. It works on your body. I've been driving truck for, since I was [REDACTED], just  a constant getting in and out of truck. I'm [REDACTED], and I'm starting to show signs in  my knees of arthritis, that constant in and out, in and out, constant up and down. ",58:08

They just did the same thing I did. They got their CDL. I mean their  commercial off-road system via mail until they finally got a worker for the department of  motor vehicles. Then, yeah, there was no driven test required for off-road system CDL.  Now, it is required, so you have to actually drive a truck. ",58:08

960,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,207,13,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  I'd rather have them get a lot of training because there's a lot of fine points with driving  truck. A lot of people don't quite understand backing the truck, getting within inches and  being able to gauge distance from how much further I could go to where I'm able to reach  to get the hose or required to fill up a tank or suck out the tank. There's a lot of little tricks  with driving, so I'd rather have somebody out here training consistently, teaching them  how to excel at their job instead of having somebody coming in that's like, ""Oh, I already  know how to do it,"" and end up having somebody that's backing in, crunching up houses  or running over vehicles.

964,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,208,2,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, I'd rather have them on a lot of on-the-job training. You get better one-on-one  training instead of instruction by a book. You get to see firsthand how to do it, and then  you have somebody right there showing you how to do it. It just slowly builds up your  confidence. You have confidence that somebody's like, ""Hey, no, stop. Okay, you're doing  good."" It's really helpful. ",58:08

Some drivers, I had to train for a full  month just so I felt they were competent enough that they were able to do the job  without causing damage to people's property and making sure that they're safe. It was a  really hazardous job. You're driving a big truck with a lot of weight that's top-heavy. So, if  you come around a corner too fast, you're tipping up on the side. [REDACTED]. I find it  takes a special breed to drive a water truck, sewer truck. It just takes a special breed of  person to do that. When you're working one-on-one with somebody, you kind of get the  feel, ""Okay, this guy's going to be all right. This guy's not."" Having to have that on-the-job  training really, really helps that aspect. ",58:08

Then, I'd correct them on little things here and there, but have somebody that wasn't  afraid to try, but learning from what they were shown. So yeah, like I said, being one-on- one, it was a lot better. I get somebody, train them to do the job officiously and safely. ",58:08

We've been back and forth to [REDACTED], so our friends call  or they'll text and say, ""Hey, your red light's on,"" like, ""Yeah, we know."" Let's see, we've  actually worked through a lot of questions. Some of the other ones… Do you ever deal  with the financial end of things with billing or people not paying their bills or people mad  about- ",58:08
990,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,209,17,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  No, that wasn't us. We drivers, we just drove. We get guys that come out. It was like,  ""Hey, I paid my bill."" It was like, ""We can't deliver your water. We can't do your sewer  until we get the say-so from so-and-so,"" so that was something that we were just like,  ""No, I can't. I just can't."" ",58:08
991,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,210,1,Interviewee ,"Interviewer 1: And, how about the routes, deciding the route, which houses get delivered in what order ",58:08
992,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,210,2,Interviewee ,and which trucks go where to make it the most efficient? ,58:08
993,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,210,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  All the drivers, we had set routes throughout the day. Mostly, some of the routes, we'd  go out to [REDACTED] twice a week or [REDACTED]… Pretty much everything was twice a  week. We split them up, and then we'd have different routes, like five water routes and,  six water routes and five sewer routes. We just went by month-by-month basis, so a driver  would do route one for a month. And then, next month, they'd do route two, then route  three so the drivers would keep consistently on knowing exactly where the water tank is  on each house. A lot of times during the wintertime driving a sewer truck, a lot of the cam  locks are underneath snow. Driving a sewer truck, it's like, ""Okay, I remember it being  right here."" You tell me a house number, I could tell you how big the tank was, how far  the tank was, where was the tank at, what side of the house it is, going around, around,  and around. ",58:08
994,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,210,4,Interviewee ,Interviewer 1: One of the training issues that had come up before was filling up water tanks without ,58:08
995,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,210,5,Interviewee ,overfilling them and the process for that. Has that been an issue? Is that part of training? ,58:08
996,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,210,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, it is part of the training. During wintertime, some people, they'll plug up your  overflow fill so it doesn't ice up or whatnot. When the overflow pipe is not functioning,  that's when the house will get filled up or flooded out. So, a lot of drivers are trained with  filling the tank. You start filling the fill. Then, you'd listen, literally stick your ear right to  the overflow, listen inside the pipe to hear if that water is going. If it's muffled or whatnot,  then we stop. Then, we know that it's not getting filled, or you can't. The chance of it  overflowing is greater. A lot of times, they'd be packed full of ice or whatnot, so we'd  bring a little chunk of metal and we'd just tap on the overflow pipe, you know, knock some  ice out or some frost down. Then, we'd be able to hear. Some of the times, you just can't  tell, so, some houses would get flooded consistently until they got the problem fixed. It's  not really the driver's fault, because you're doing 50 houses a day, and you're constantly.  Like I said, that job, it's not an easy job at all. ",58:08
997,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,210,7,Interviewee ,"Interviewer 1: It seems like, also, if you're a customer, your service is going to depend a lot on the driver ",58:08
998,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,210,8,Interviewee ,"you get. If they're willing to pull into your driveway, if the car's too close, or if they're  willing to take the time to knock ice out of your pipe, or if they're listening. ",58:08
999,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,210,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  There's some drivers. You never know with each person. Say you've got a sprained ankle.  I'm not going to want to have to drag my hose through a total obstacle course around two  vehicles and pipes and garbage in the way just to get to your tank when, if you'd have  your vehicle out of the way, it'd make it a whole lot easier for me. That's part of the  problem. Some of the drivers just would not do that, and there's a lot of drivers that will.  But all the drivers that I've trained, it was like, “Hey, man, you just knuckle up and do what  you got to do to get it done.” That's some of it, but, majority of the drivers, they're willing  to work with somebody who will blast your air horn, go knock on the doors like, ""Hey, can  you move your vehicle? I'll go ahead and get another house until you get your vehicle ",58:08
1000,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,211,1,Interviewee ,"warmed up and out of the way? Then, I'll just come right back, or I'll get you on the next  load."" So, there's a lot of interaction there with a lot of people. ",58:08

1002,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,211,3,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  They're really strict on the water quality with the trucks. The water, it has to be EPA  standard, so pretty much every truck gets tested. The tanks get tested, and they're  constantly being tested. We do water tests at the pump house. They check to make sure  whatever the EPA standard is, make sure it's falling within the guidelines. The only time  that we'd really have problems with the truck if it was broken down and it sat too long.  We'd shock the tank. Basically, we'd empty out the water truck. We sterilize it, rinse it out  a couple of times with fresh water. Then, we'd put it back to use again. ",58:08
1003,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,211,4,Interviewee ,"Interviewer 1: So, this meeting standards for safety, does anyone complain about other things: taste, ",58:08

1005,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,211,6,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  Yeah, sometimes they do. It's not the driver or the truck's fault. It's the water is coming  out of the ground. It's none of the drivers' fault at all. We have no control over that. We're  just there to deliver what we got. If you pump wells consistently, the well is eventually  going to run dry and you're going to start picking up debris. It is what it is. ",58:08

In general, if someone was moving to  [REDACTED], is hauled water generally pretty good compared to for taste and smell and  color? Should people be happy with it or should they plan on having rusty water? ",58:08
1008,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 12 ,211,9,Interviewee ,"Interviewee:  It's hard to say. When I was on pipe water, I had no problem with that. I didn't have smell,  taste, nothing funny. It was only when I was on pipe water that they had the rust issue,  you know, because of the rusty pipes, water becoming yellowish or brownish. That was  back in the '90s and whatnot. I personally had Brita water filters and filtered my water for  drinking water because just of that purpose right there. ",58:08

A lot of people, they're not used to being  on a hauled water system, so they're not nearly as frugal. We get new people coming in,  and they're used to leaving their sink running when you brush your teeth instead of filling  up a cup and turning off the water. That's where a lot of the culture shock comes in.  Hopefully that was helpful there. ",58:08

1035,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,214,2,Interviewee ,[REDACTED]. So we moved to [REDACTED]. And I was gonna hunt and fish. That was expensive. So I got a  job. That's the short of it. ,00:45
1041,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,214,2,Interviewer 1 ,So what do you do? Tell us about your job. ,01:08
1036,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,214,2,Interviewee ,[REDACTED]. I work with water and sewer systems and villages as a technical assistance provider to assist  them in fixing equipment or adjusting treatment or thawing frozen pipes.

1042,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,214,2,Interviewer 1 ,Great. It sounds like you didn't move out there with that intention. So what's your background of training  or what brought you to that?  ,01:40

It wasn't a planned thing at all. They were like, great, it would be good to have a  guy that knows structural stuff on our team. [REDACTED]. But I've learned a lot along the way. So, I've  learned everything I know about water and sewer while I've been here working on water and sewer. ",01:56
1043,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,214,2,Interviewer 1 ,That was kind of my next question and that was when you got here so it's been [REDACTED] years. ,02:53
1038,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,214,2,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Yeah, so I've been doing this, [REDACTED]. But I was still involved just in smaller ways during that  time. ",02:59
1044,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,214,2,Interviewer 1 ,"So, in the in that time, did you pick up any certifications? You have to do any schooling? ",03:13
1045,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,215,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, so um, in my first 90 days, I had to pass the test for level one operator, I didn't have the time and  place to get the certification, but I had to pass the test, I passed the test. And then since I've got the hours,  I actually hold a level [REDACTED] certification in water, a level [REDACTED] certification in distribution,  [REDACTED] wastewater treatment and a [REDACTED] wastewater collection as well as a lagoons  [REDACTED]. I passed the test. I've tested to higher levels, but I can't get those certifications because I  don't have a higher-level plant to work in. But I've passed a level [REDACTED] water certification and level  [REDACTED] water distribution certification test too.  ",03:25
1049,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,215,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay, so we'll probably have some questions about that, too. Yeah. Did you do that because, I mean, is  that a requirement of the job? Or is that? ",04:22
1046,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,215,1,Interviewee ,"Um, yeah, that's kind of interesting. Um, I only have to be certified to whatever level of water plants I  work with. In my job, I've been on several committees with different things with the state and one of  those was about some operator certification and I had complaints about the operator certification  program. Not letting people continue on if they wanted to. So, it used to be, if you didn't have the hours,  you couldn't take the next level test. I said, well, that, you know, like, if someone's interested in learning  and studying, and they just passed their first, why not let them continue to study and move through their  second without, you know, sitting for a couple years to gain those hours? [REDACTED]. They actually  changed the regulations. So, you can you can test at any level. And then you don't get those certifications  until you have the time in and experience at that plant level. [REDACTED]. ",04:37
1050,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,215,1,Interviewer 1 ,Is that typical of [REDACTED] remote maintenance workers? ,06:02
1047,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,215,1,Interviewee ,"No. Most of them will shun a test so hard and so fast, or any paperwork for that matter. So yeah, yeah,  it's not it's not probably typical. But um, yeah. ",06:11
1051,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,215,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So definitely, there's people. So, you don't need to get those certifications to do the job. Other people are  doing the job without. ",06:29
1048,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,215,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, we have a couple of remote maintenance workers. [REDACTED]. So, like, crazy amount of  experience. Those guys have. [REDACTED] has a level [REDACTED] certification, that's the highest level of  any plant that he has. [REDACTED] has level [REDACTED], it's the highest that he has. But um, a couple of  the other guys haven't passed a level [REDACTED] tests, they have level [REDACTED] plants, but they can  tell you everything about that plant, they can adjust that plant, they do have a hard time testing and so.  So yeah, so it's not required, [REDACTED] has taken his level [REDACTED] test and got his level [REDACTED]  certification as well. So, but for the most part, most of our RMWs - very good hands-on, not very good  with a book as far as testing and stuff. So ",06:38
1054,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,216,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So, you know, we've been talking about [REDACTED], can you walk us through a little bit what that job  looks like? ",07:59
1052,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,216,1,Interviewee ,"I sit at this desk and wait for the phone to ring and someone have a dire emergency. And it happens every  weekend when I'm not working. Yeah, so day to day, we're calling in, checking in with water plants, seeing  if they're doing preventative maintenance, working on little like long term projects with them or stuff. But  then the real like where we really earn our money when it comes to emergencies. And they have a freeze  up or some kind of, you know, catastrophic issue. We come in with the expertise to like to help them out  in that. So, we provide a resource of we have tools, specialized tools that we keep here in [REDACTED]  that we can ship out, that they may not have locally, as well as the expertise to do more specialized tasks  than the local operator's trained to do. So, a big component of our what we do is training. Ideally, we  don't, we don't go out and do work for them, we go out and train them to do the work. You know, in the  past, sometimes it's not been the case, sometimes we'll be out there three, four weeks working doing the  work. But we really tried to get away from that and be more focused on we're going to go out and train  you how to do this, right? That might take a week or two but then from there on out, you're going to carry  the rest of the task out if it's not complete. So that sometimes even works. Sometimes we lived there for  three or four weeks. So ",08:07
1055,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,216,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So, when you when you go out there, you're working with water plant operators. And I mean sometimes  there must be other people helping too, right like so if there's a lot to do is that Is that members of the  public? Or are there other? Who are the who else helps, ",09:47
1053,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,216,1,Interviewee ,"Who are these people? Hmm. That's one of our requirements is that we don't, we don't respond to an  emergency without local workers. So primarily, the water plant operators are our top person, whoever  those are, one or multiple. And then depending on the task that we have, we will ask the tribe or the city,  whoever the entity is to provide additional workers, whatever they're needed. So, we might have one or  two that are skilled in what we're doing. And then a bunch of others that are just labor that need a lot  more direction and teaching. Those are generally paid by the city or the tribe, whoever runs the water  utility, we don't have any funds to pay workers on the ground. So yeah, so we work with whoever that  entity is. Give them basically the man hours we think we need, how many people and whatever other  requirements of vehicles and fuel and things. And then, uh, then we arrive. Very rarely do we have any  volunteers show up just to help. Although that has happened on a few larger things, [REDACTED] being  one in particular, we had to move a sewer line back into the lagoon. And the community just called out  for all available men to come with four wheelers and snow machines and we drug 600 feet of sewer line  back up the hill into the lagoon and just using four wheelers and manpower. So that was pretty neat. But  for the most part, most of the people are paid labor. ",10:04
1056,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,216,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay, well, so I'm curious how that works. Right? So, if there's, if there's an emergency, I mean, you're  kind of you're, how does all the money work? Right? What if the village doesn't have any money? Or ",11:50
1059,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,217,1,Interviewer 1 ,"doesn't pay anyone to help? Or I mean, it's still, then you just do it? Or what? A little bit of a soft process  there. ",11:50
1057,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,217,1,Interviewee ,"There is a soft process here. So, there's, there gets to be the political part, right? So, a lot of times the  village doesn't necessarily have money. But, you know, they maybe have money. So, you know, I never  asked like, how their finances are, and do they have, you know, $100,000 to support this project? It's  never a question I asked. I say, “Can you provide me this many people?” And they say yes or no. And if  they say, “No”, say, well, we need to reevaluate, like we're not coming to do it without. We, we've  understood from doing this long enough. What we need to be successful on different tasks, like how big  of a crew we need, what kind of support we need for the weather and things like that. We can't put that  together. We're not going to mobilize and just be out there and being unsuccessful. We've done that in  the past. Nobody's no one's happy. When you spend four weeks and you get nowhere, you're still in the  same spot four weeks later. So. So yeah, so the on their end, if they don't provide workers or whatever  supplies we need, fuel and things like that, on the ground. We were just at an impasse, like that thing will  remain frozen until that changes, or that problem will remain a problem. And so, then it gets a little more  complex. Politically, you know, they have to ask for help from other entities that have financial, again,  we're grant-funded through the state of Alaska, USDA, and EPA. But none of that is dollars we can give to  a community. So we're free to them. We can fly our gear in and out, we can cover all that, we can fly our  people in and out, but they have to provide that manpower that that we need on the ground. So yeah, so  yeah, it's kind of a it's kind of an odd process. And if they truly don't have the funds, then they're going to  ask the state or they're going to we do have some other partner agencies, we can ask for some emergency  funds. But we're talking those emergency funds tap at like 10 grand. So pretty small. And that's generally  for parts, not for people. Manpower has to be funded at the local level. Sometimes if it's a big enough  emergency, they can then get reimbursement from the state or from the Federal after they've expended  those funds, but they never get reimbursed up front. They never get a money chunk and then so ",12:14
1060,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,217,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Do you ever work with just, I mean I guess sometimes you would then? Do you ever work with just  community members on water? Do you talk to people about water? ",14:56
1058,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,217,1,Interviewee ,"We get lots of calls. So we're, there's always, you know, this morning I came in, there was emails about,  you know, a system has been frozen up for about [REDACTED] weeks now. It serves [REDACTED] buildings  in town. And one of those [REDACTED] buildings called and was like, you know, when's this thing gonna  get fixed? And that's just a community member, you know, concern because it was the [REDACTED] that  doesn't have water now for [REDACTED] weeks. So yeah, we field all kinds of calls from community  members. We get calls that get directed to us, because they're technical questions about the water that  a local person, maybe a water plant operator, or the Tribal Administrator can't explain. So then they like  forward those to us so we can help explain an issue better to someone. So yeah, so we end up doing a lot  of community relations in there in between. A couple of weeks ago, and had to cancel our visit, I ended  up meeting with one of the community members there, because they've been very involved with a lot of  sewer over the years, they're really concerned about what was going on. That ended up just being going ",15:07
1061,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,218,1,Interviewee ,"having coffee and sitting and talking for a bit and, you know, bringing them up to date on what the issues  were and they're a strong advocate in that community. So hopefully, it works out as a bonus. ",15:07
1065,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,218,1,Interviewer 1 ,"When you say a strong advocate, a strong advocate for treated water for piped water for what? ",16:33
1062,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,218,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, that's a community that has only had pipe water for [REDACTED] now. [REDACTED]. And so most of  her life, she has not had pipe water. And she's a very strong advocate for her community, having piped  water for her [REDACTED]. And she's just, she's a thorn in your side when there's a problem. So she  specifically actually called me to see if I was involved in helping them. And I'm like, Yeah, I'm actually  coming up there today. And that's when she wanted to meet and talk about what's actually going on. And  she's done that multiple times over the years when they've had issues. She doesn't feel like she's getting  a good answer locally, she just has my cell phone. And so she just calls me and will ask what's up and, and  am I coming to help.  ",16:41
1066,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,218,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Sounds like those conversations go okay, though. ",17:45
1063,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,218,1,Interviewee ,"Generally, most the time they go okay. Sometimes people are not, are not happy with the answers,  especially when there's when there's a perceived issue that they have, that is not actually a real issue for  the community, or not something that can be addressed. We actually have probably the most complaints  from school teachers. And I don't know if it's just because the last couple of years, I've dealt with a ton of  school complaint issues, but we get a lot of complaints from school teachers that are super unhappy with  the quality of water that they get when a lot of times the rest of the community doesn't get that quality  or quantity of water. So it's pretty hard to stomach. ",17:49
1067,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,218,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So I have a question about that then. Because I mean, a lot of schools have their own well, right? ",18:36
1064,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,218,1,Interviewee ,"No, it's actually [REDACTED] has a lot of its own wells, primarily in communities where there is no running  water. So they have their own well to provide running water for their community, or for their teachers,  not the community. Some places they do provide water for the community. But a lot of the lot of schools  are hooked to the community water system. And so yeah, so then there are issues and we've been dealing  with a couple lately. Excuse me, that, um, they've come off as spoiled kids, is how they sound when they're  ranting about how teachers are leaving because of the water conditions ",18:45
1068,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,218,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, I mean, so when we're talking about teachers, my impression is we're probably talking about folks  that aren't from the community? ",19:36
1069,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,219,1,Interviewee ,Folks that are not from the community brought in from outside. Yeah. So. ,19:48
1073,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,219,1,Interviewer 1 ,Okay. I just wanna make sure that what's what that's what I thought you were saying. ,19:54
1070,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,219,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, but yeah, very clear, good point ",19:59
1133,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,228,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So then we're kind of using the national test, which it seems like is not maybe a useful tool. ",1:00:29
1130,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,228,1,Interviewee ,"We used to use a state specific test that was designed around actually had some Alaska State questions  on it. We use a national test now. Matter of fact, the test is even, it's through ABC. I don't remember what  ABC stands for. Something, something something. But um, but that test is now not even just being used  nationally, but also internationally. Canada's adopted the same test and some European foreign countries.  So like, a lot of the details that are like that you would learn that are important to actually how your plant  operates have been taken out, because those are national standards or state standards. Now we're talking  the international test. So everything just like concept stuff, which is like the hardest for them. So I feel like  our, our test has got less relevant. Well not just feel like, it has actually got less relevant over time to the  people locally, which is harder for them to grasp and understand and pass. So ",1:00:38
1137,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,229,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So one of the things, you know, you're talking about, like are the questions, the right questions, but then  you also talked about just sort of, based on people's culture or background, or you know, their educational  history or whatever, they're having a hard time with the actual sort of the mechanics of the test, as well.  Is that I mean, is that a solvable problem? Is there a ways to teach or ways to address that? ",1:01:51
1135,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,229,1,Interviewee ,"um, there are, I mean, there, there are ways to address that. So we've worked on doing some different  things with education, because COVID kind of threw everything on its head. So we've actually had the  most success with actually with an online training. But I don't think it was successful because it was online,  it was successful, because it was spread out over a six week period. With like, stuff every other day, and  tutoring every day in between, if you want it. So like there was a lot of man hours put in, change in format,  a lot more, a lot more time taken per subject and stuff. And we still found major holes that we're trying  to improve for the next round. So there's things to improve. [REDACTED], it was a state test. Now, this  international test, it's completely the wrong direction to move. You know, it's done for lots of reasons.  But those reasons don't help. Don't help people locally. I just, it's not the direction we should be moving  as a state. It's ease, it's expedience. It's different things. But yeah. I don't know if that answers it or not. ",1:02:21
1138,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,229,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I mean, so it sounds like more hours of training helps, right? ",1:03:52
1136,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,229,1,Interviewee ,"More hours of training definitely help, which is a challenge, you know, with distance between  communities and like, you know, it means you have to pay an operator to sit at a computer or something  and do or you have to pay them to come to [REDACTED] and do that training. That's expensive. I mean,  training is not cheap. More hours seems to help. Honestly, I think a huge, operator certification is super  rigid. On the test taking, a lot of people can get accommodations for other certification tests, that operator  certification will not allow on the drinking water test. So you know someone's graduated college can get  accommodations for reading disabilities or something and get a certification test read to them. Operators  certification won't allow an operator who doesn't speak English or doesn't read English very well to have  the test read to them, even though that might be the difference between them passing and not. So there's  like small things that could be done. Without changing the whole system. I would advocate, we rebuild  the whole system, because we've got into some really weird morphed thing that really doesn't suit our  need. I don't think. Most of it, let me let me just say this one other thing, before in case we move on, most  of it is driven by reciprocity. And that's the thing the state says like, well, whoever takes this test can take  this thing anywhere. And that works good. If you live [REDACTED] and you plan on moving from  [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] to [REDACTED]. But most of our operators in rural Alaska, are  never moving to [REDACTED] to work, let alone moving to [REDACTED]. So reciprocity doesn't make a  difference for 90% of the communities in the state. ",1:03:57
1139,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,229,1,Interviewer 1 ,"How much of the training that you're doing, I mean, is there any amount of it that's sort of, like test taking  skills or like, you know, training about testing versus training about subject matter? ",1:06:19
1140,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,230,1,Interviewee ,"We've done some of that. We've stuck in some portions, spend a couple hours out of our week training  on test taking skills. Teach them all the tricks you can, you know. But some of that is something that  doesn't play culturally, very well, is the other thing we found. They don't understand why, you know, why  we're trying to trick them. Why do they have to learn this trick to like, understand what's going on? And  so that's kind of a hard thing. How do you, you know, like, I don't know it's what you got to do. But that  doesn't sit well. ",1:06:35
1143,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,230,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Right. No, I, yeah. Which one of these answers is not correct? You take a three-hour test at six in the  morning. And yeah, yeah. Okay, I know. We're getting a little short on time. But I know that you live in  [REDACTED]. And so I've been asking the same question. And I'm curious if somebody was moving to  [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] was moving to [REDACTED] from [REDACTED]. And she said, hey, I heard you  know, water is an issue. But I'm looking to find a place to live. What advice would you give her? ",1:07:20
1141,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,230,1,Interviewee ,"Bring piles of money so you can have all the water you want. I'm on hauled water, I pay [REDACTED] a  month now, for my water, sewer. Love it. And I forgot to thaw my fill. So I didn't get a water delivery this  last week, I'm still gonna pay the same amount. My advice would be get a house on the pipe system.  Because the water is less and there's more of it. That's my advice to most people coming in. So I chose to  buy a house because I liked my location more than water. ",1:07:55
1144,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,230,1,Interviewer 2 ,"And another question kind of on the same vein, but more in terms of communities that aren't served yet  maybe have like a central watering point. What do you think kind of is best case there? There's a lot of  discussions about like systems like PASS and things like that. And I think we've heard opinions across the  spectrum in terms of what these communities deserve. What is your kind of perspective there? Do you,  is your goal to get everyone pipe systems? ",1:08:41
1142,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,230,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I mean, pipe system. PASS is a disaster that we just haven't found out is a disaster yet. But everything  we've learned over the years, like went out the window when they designed PASS. I'm not even sure it's  better than nothing is the problem, right? It's the perception you have something but you really don't  have anything more than the bucket of water you've already hauled. It's just now in this thing so I can get  it out of my faucet. but yeah, our perspective is piped water and sewer for every community. That is the  thing that's going to change the health issues. It's going to have the greatest impact. Mmm, is that long  term sustainable? I think it is in more places than we give it credit for. I don't think we look at sustainability  right. When we get pipes in a community, it's amazing. The community could not afford a honey bucket  system, but all of the sudden they can afford a pipe water system, because it's something worth paying  for. No one's gonna pay a dime for PASS. PASS has a lot of parts that need to be changed and fixed. It's  kind of a complex system, we've done that with co-water, we've done that with different things. Long  term, they always run into these huge roadblocks. And the service doesn't equal the cost. You know, I pay  [REDACTED] a month for my water, not because I want to. But because that's what gets me a level of  service that I don't have to worry when I turn on my faucet or when I flush my toilet, I'm gonna have  water. And so communities we found can afford much more than, like the EPA modeling says they can. ",1:09:13
1145,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,231,1,Interviewee ,"And they're willing to pay more for good service. So I really think pipe water is the best thing for most  communities. Some of our smaller communities, it might not be, you know, I'd like to see more individual  wells in some small communities and septics and things where it's more sustainable. But I think that we  can have like, high level of water use at every home. It's just gonna look a little different in each house,  each community. ",1:09:13
1147,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,231,1,Interviewer 1 ,Well we're kind of pushing up against time. I super appreciate this. This is really good stuff. Useful. What  am I missing [REDACTED]? What other things would you want us to know? What should I have asked you  about? ,1:11:49
1146,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,231,1,Interviewee ,"I don't know. We've talked about a lot. Um, alright. Yeah, water sewer. It's um, it goes on and on. ",1:12:09
1148,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,231,1,Interviewer 1 ,Is there anyone else you think I should talk to? ,1:12:22
1075,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,219,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Are a lot of the complaints kind of more about the aesthetics of the water like taste, smell, not necessarily  like the quality like primary water regulation, more? ",20:02
1071,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,219,1,Interviewee ,"Almost every complaint is about aesthetics. Occasionally, we'll get some higher-level complaints that are  actually really justified about water quality. But that's generally when like a village is way out of  compliance for a long time and someone you know, wants to know why and how come we can't get it  back. But most of it is just aesthetics. ",20:16
1074,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,219,1,Interviewer 1 ,So it sounds like you work all over the place. So some of these questions might need to qualify a little bit  but can you tell me about the how drinking water is provided in the places that you work? ,20:44
1072,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,219,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, yes. Um, so yeah, I basically I have communities that I work with that have all levels of service from  fully piped, turn on the sink in the home and safe drinking water comes out of the tap. So just standard  flush the toilet, it all goes away like it's a standard, you know, pressure system gravity. So then, that'd be  [REDACTED]. It's standard, what you'd see in lower 48. No extra freeze protection stuff or anything. They  don't even circulate the water. But they have buried pipes and they're warmer little pocket of climate  where they're at. Most of my pipe communities have a circulating water system. So circulates treated  water, always moving around the village being heated. And then you know, comes into your tap and then  goes out either through a gravity sewer with lift station or we have several low pressure. Low pressure  sewer systems like a little lift station at every house. So then we have haul systems, I have several  communities that are a small haul system, they have a 200 gallon trailer that they take around and haul  water to houses they fill a anywhere from 100 to 150 gallon tank in the house with water that's treated  water that comes from the water plant hauled to the house, pumped into the tank. And then they have a  septic tank that is pumped out weekly as well or monthly however often they get service. Most of those  small haul communities do service on an as-call basis. So in other words, it's not a regular service.  Whenever the home calls for service, they get service. It's the most expensive way to run that system.  Because there's absolutely no management of where that trailer is going to haul water or pickup  sewerage. Like all over and sometimes the guy just sits around waiting for someone to call. Then I have  communities that have a central watering point. And this is either at a washateria or just at a well building  and they can go fill containers and they self-haul their water from there. Generally, in large trash cans or  five-gallon buckets, haul it to their house some people take that in and put it inside some people just  bypass the watering point completely go down to the river and chip ice because they prefer the ice water ",20:59
1076,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,220,1,Interviewee ,"over the treated water with chlorine and they some people use the ice water. So all different levels. In a  lot of the self-hauled communities, people will haul water for cleaning but chip ice for drinking. And so a  little different than you'd expect. They like the taste of ice water. The cleaning water is much easier to get  from the haul point because you just pull up press a button and it comes out of the hose. So yeah. The  self-haul ones where they're self-hauling water. They're generally on honey buckets. So their waste is in a  honey bucket that they either self-haul to a lagoon or they put out and it's collected and hauled to the  lagoon for them. ",20:59
1080,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,220,1,Interviewer 1 ,How has the situation changed over time? I guess you've got [REDACTED] years right? Have you seen? ,25:04
1077,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,220,1,Interviewee ,"Lot of things have changed. Lots of things stayed the same. I've had a few communities go from honey  bucket to fully piped, which has been interesting to watch that process. And watch how it changes that.  I've had communities go from hauled to pipe as well. But honestly, there's [REDACTED] communities out  of [REDACTED], [REDACTED] communities out of [REDACTED] I started with that have moved up in service.  So most of my communities have stayed the same as they were [REDACTED] years ago. So. Yeah. ",25:12
1081,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,220,1,Interviewer 2 ,"And following up on that, have you seen any kind of more deterioration of some of these maybe because  of aging infrastructure? Or not really? It's kind of just stayed the same? ",25:58
1078,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,220,1,Interviewee ,"No, it's a complete disaster. Um, yeah, I mean, we have, we have plants that, you know, they're built with  a 20 year life expectancy, generally, and most all of the plants were past their 20 year life expectancy  when I started work. And we're still using some of those plants today. Yeah, probably half my water plants  are still operating the old plants they did [REDACTED] years ago. And so some of those with utterly crazy  plans to rehab and continue using that facility another [REDACTED] years. We're talking about a facility  was made in the [REDACTED] and was barely adequate then. And now we're talking about using it for  another [REDACTED] years from now. So yeah. Yeah. ",26:10
1082,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,220,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Do you find that I, we kind of touched a little bit on the funding piece earlier, but is it almost easier to get  things funded if something goes really wrong, like and using emergency funding, compared to actually like  maintaining the system or improving it. ",27:10
1079,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,220,1,Interviewee ,"So [REDACTED] was a perfect example. It's [REDACTED], that the village of [REDACTED], their water plant  burnt down. They've been in this process the entire time [REDACTED], they've got money and lost money  because they couldn't meet funding requirements. So money was allocated and went away. And money  was allocated and went away. They were at [REDACTED], they had been in a [REDACTED] to meet some  requirements. So funding can be released under special conditions to finish work that was started  [REDACTED] years ago. So this was just a little bit of funding to finish up work. Not even to build the new  water plant yet. And that was getting nowhere, like literally, the money wouldn't be released because it ",27:26
1083,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,221,1,Interviewee ,"couldn't meet some things like nothing was happening. We weren't even talking about a new water plant  yet. Their water plant burnt to the ground, instantly an emergency. Everybody, they now have  [REDACTED] in place. And they will have a water plant, a new water plant [REDACTED] in the village. Right  now [REDACTED] helped arrange get in there. But um, more funding has been released and spent  [REDACTED], more progress has been made than the entire [REDACTED] before that. Because emergency  made, and it was it was one of those plants that was it was over [REDACTED]. And it was in horrible shape  after [REDACTED]. I mean, we had, you know liners in water storage tanks because they'd actually rotted  through. And we were needing to replace the liners because the liners were leaking because they were  past their life expectancy. I mean, I was like yeah, we had epoxy holding the filter vessel from just spraying  water out. Crazy level of worn-out equipment. And the village actually spent, ahead of that fire, they had  spent I don't know [REDACTED] dollars upgrading pumps and filter parts and they had done a great job in  [REDACTED] prior to that. Bringing the water quality up in the plant and like making a lot of expensive  repairs. That got them nowhere towards a new project [REDACTED]. ",27:26

1087,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,221,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So talking about people a little bit, you know, we've heard you talk about people that call you because  they're advocates. But we've also heard you say that, you know, some people happily prefer to drink, you  know, chipped ice. So, can you talk to us a little bit about what water infrastructure means to the people  that you work with? ",30:29
1085,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,221,1,Interviewee ,"So you know, the common thing is, most people think of water as in drinking. And the real benefit we  found in this region is not water as in drinking, but water availability, for cleaning, for bathing, for all that  stuff. Communities that haven't had running water at their house, once they get used to the adjustment,  and they can just put the kids in the bathtub and run the bath. And this is actually more with the  grandparents than with the parents is the interesting thing. The grandparents are so excited that they can  do this with their grandkids, because they've lived so long without this, it's like it's a dream come true to  have these, these basic functions of water in the house, they may still chip ice for their preferred drinking  water. But they love the fact that they can wash and that they can clean and they see a lot of disease rates  go down and other stuff. So the water infrastructure is much more than just about drinking. And the  largest benefit and why most people want to keep it is not the drinking water aspect, but all the other  aspects of it, how it changes their life. ",30:56
1088,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,221,1,Interviewer 1 ,"We talked about some of the challenges that water infrastructure faces. And about sort of, so it seems  like there's issues of sort of quality and of quantity. And then also the sort of the quality issue is sort of  split into two pieces. You talked about aesthetic quality, but then there's also sort of, is water safe to ",32:25
1092,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,222,1,Interviewer 1 ,"drink? Is that, am I kind of understanding the, you know if somebody said, well what's the problem with  water? Am I getting that right? Or is there more to that? ",32:25
1089,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,222,1,Interviewee ,"Um, no, that's, that's pretty good. There is the aesthetic, and then the, whether it's safe to drink. And you  know, the safe to drink is interesting, because that's driven by national standards. And that creates a lot  of cost and a lot of burden in communities because they don't necessarily make sense for the community  and where it's at. They can produce a safe water that may not meet the standards. And so that is a whole  interesting thing. It's like you get this thing that says your water is bad, even though your water is perfectly  safe to drink. But it's not meeting some national standard that kind of doesn't apply well.  ",33:05
1093,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,222,1,Interviewer 1 ,Can you give an example?  ,34:01
1090,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,222,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, so we have several systems that are groundwater under the direct influence of surface water. So  these are shallow wells, [REDACTED] is one of them. [REDACTED] has had this groundwater under direct  influence of surface water designation [REDACTED]. That well was put in in the [REDACTED]. And the state  just decided to reclassify it based on its depth and proximity to the river. There's never been a positive  coliform sample. There's never been anything scientifically that says that that water is not safe to drink.  But they don't meet the drinking water standard because now it's treated as surface water. Their systems  not good enough to treat surface water, doesn't make the right treatment points. So it could potentially  make you sick, although it never has. And so now, you know. So we have that same example, repeated  over and over in communities. So some reclassification at some level creates a problem. And like, it's not  really addressing a problem that really exists. [REDACTED], again, they're the same thing, they have a  GWUDI well, but that well has, like, always been solid. Never. I mean, it's like so. So they're on boil water  notice, like, permanently, they can't meet treatment standards. So, yeah, so stuff like that is pretty  common. And so, aesthetically, both of those are some of the best water that we have. But won't meet  the standard. And never made anybody sick. So, like, yeah. ",34:07
1094,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,222,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So pivoting a little bit. Seasonality, are there times of the year that you have specific problems or more  problems? ",36:06
1091,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,222,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I mean, right now we're in the midst of winter and things freeze. [REDACTED], it's raining out. But  um, you know, we'll be below zero by the end of the week, so things will freeze again. Right now we have  [REDACTED] water systems in the [REDACTED] that we have that are frozen up. So we have a lot of freeze  up issues. midwinter starting right around, well, starting at Thanksgiving. And then again, at New Year's,  two spikes in times that we see freeze-ups due to weather and days off coinciding in bad ways. Then come  spring, when we have break up, we have a lot of flooding on [REDACTED]. So that creates seasonal issues  there. This winter, we've had, we had a warm up at Christmas time that created a lot of treatment issues  with our surface water systems. We had a week of rain. And we saw water consistency changed from  what we see normally during the winter to normally what we see during the summer, which meant like ",36:19
1095,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,223,1,Interviewee ,"mid in a week, we had to all of the sudden change all of our treatment scheme from our winter program  to our summer program. And then like couple weeks later, we had to switch it all back. It created quite a  bit of disruption and a couple of the plants running out of water because they didn't catch that everything  changed until they dropped quite a bit of water level. So So yeah, so there are seasonal variations. Our  surface waters all generally have like a summer and a winter thing. With sometimes some special things  you have to do during break up when they have some real high turbidity issues. Groundwater is much  more stable throughout the year. But we do have a lot of seasonal issues with freezing, freezing pipes,  freezing water plants during the winter.  ",36:19
1099,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,223,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And what about, like long term weather changes? Is that affecting water infrastructure, like climate  change? ",38:27
1096,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,223,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, you know, we also live [REDACTED]. So we have a lot of erosion issues. And sometimes that happens  drastically, we've noticed, you know, some communities, we've had to move back infrastructure. From  the river as the river erodes, we've actually like been lopping off parts of the pipe and like pulling it back,  so it doesn't go into the river. Which is an interesting, [REDACTED] getting close in one community to have  to move a whole part of the circulating main. And that will become a true emergency that no one's even  funded yet. And it will cost quite a bit to do to move that. That won't be an easy just dig it up and move it  project that'll be a couple of million dollars. So yeah, so we do see some issues with that. And it kinda you  know, it comes and goes. Sometimes we can see really fast erosion in a community, and then it can change  and we're like really slow down because something's changed in the river. It starts moving the other way.  We've seen more turbidity issues, not as many as were predicted with global warming. There was a lot of  predictions a few years ago, that it was going to spike way up more. It hasn't quite, but we have seen  changes in source water. So we'll see, it's always, it's always changing. But it's changing in some different  ways lately. So ",38:38
1100,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,223,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Looking at the big picture of water infrastructure that you work with, what's the big thing? If you could  change one thing if you had whatever you needed to have, a magic wand? ",40:14
1097,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,223,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Um, I think when I think of the magic wand, I think it changes by what I'm dealing with currently. ",40:32
1101,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,223,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Need a couple of wands? Okay, right. Yeah. ",40:46
1098,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,223,1,Interviewee ,"So there's different times where I see different problems. Lately, something I've been noticing, and I think  would be really helpful. It's not actually not the water plant operators. But it's the managers over the  water plant operators, or the village infrastructure, or city infrastructure, whichever it is, isn't a recipe for  success. So when there's problems in that management above the guy that's doing the thing on the  ground, it's just, it's a game changer, the right input the right things, a problem gets solved easy, the wrong ",40:48
1102,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,224,1,Interviewee ,"and we just flounder with it. And so that's one of the things I see is the magic wand, if I could wave anything  and change some of that, that management. But also like, we have a ton of aging infrastructure, that it  doesn't matter how good a management we have, we're putting band aids on top of band aid. And without  replacing that aging infrastructure, we're just, you know, we're never going to succeed. We're just going  to hold it off a little bit longer. So those are my two if I had two, the aging infrastructure, completely  would. And then some management things locally, I think can make a huge difference. And that's not  necessarily education, either. Everyone's like, oh, you need some more education, about management,  no one needs education about management. I think for a big part is I see that there's like changing,  changing how they do management at a local level to make it work locally. A lot of it's somebody told  them a plan, and they follow that plan. And, you know, I had water plant operators getting laid off the day  the water tank ran out of water. And I was in the village for emergency work. And they were getting told  to go home, we don't have money to pay you. I'm like there's a disconnect here. That's like, you know,  yeah, it was kind of like it showed like, they're using an outside plan of you know, this many dollars, you  know, you only have this, you need to cut this but like, they had a different problem. It didn't fit the  formula they had been taught of management and so yeah, so, so some of that some real customized to  like, drill down and find out what's not working in a particular situation and then like, fix it. That'd be my  magic wand. A little sociology, a little economics all waved together. ",40:48
1105,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,224,1,Interviewer 1 ,"When you're talking about management, and that sort of thing. I mean, I'm thinking of like there, the state  of Alaska has some sort of program to help tribes or rural administration, right. They kind of do audits or  whatever is that ",43:45
1103,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,224,1,Interviewee ,They have Rural Utility Business Administration? ,44:05
1106,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,224,1,Interviewer 1 ,RUBA ,44:12
1104,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,224,1,Interviewee ,"RUBA, I was trying think what it stood for, we just all say RUBA so often. And so yeah, they are tasked with  training in the business end of the water and sewer. And they also do a lot of the regulation of the business  end of the water and sewer. Over the years, they have leaned way more towards the regulation end than  the training end. And so yeah, a lot of they've been they've been limited internally due to their own  leadership decisions about travel to villages for I think [REDACTED] years. So their people have not been  out traveling to villages unless the village pays to bring them in. And so that has really limited their ability  to speak into a lot of those situations and improve. And honestly, most of the villages don't see value in  the advice they get. Very few of those RUBA people, might show a little my bias but, don't have business  experience. Have never actually worked in a water sewer utility. They're checking checklists. And it's  training by checklist. And so it's not necessarily the function training that someone on the ground needs.  So. ",44:13
1111,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,225,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And the training that they're doing, though, is would be for like a Tribal Administrator, kind of. Yeah,  they're not working with operators, are they? ",45:53
1107,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,225,1,Interviewee ,"They're not working with the operators. No, it's doing some quick books, you know, do you? Do you have  the right? Are minutes getting done right at your board meetings, is your water plant operator giving a  report to the tribe? It's just kind of some things like that, but they're like these check points. Like, this is  what best practices, you should do this, but those don't necessarily correlate to the problem that may be  in a community. So. And they're not there in the community to know if it's correlating or not. That's part  of the issue. You got to kind of be present. Get into things find out. ",46:02
1112,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,225,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Well I think we're probably going to pivot a little bit and talk about operators and operator training. Before  I do, [REDACTED], is there anything? Anything? ",46:46
1114,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,225,1,Interviewer 2 ,"No, I don't think so. I think I asked my follow up, follow up questions as they were coming. Well, actually,  one thing you might have already said it, but how many communities do you serve? Or work with? Do you  have kind of a set amount? Or? ",47:00

So we  generally do small treated and level one. We haven't offered any level two trainings in a long time in our  region. So yeah, we do those in person, we also do some specialty skills training, we do boiler training, we  do electrical controls. We're developing a plumbing training right now. Basic pipe fitting, basically. So we  do both some book training, which would be the level one, level two, and lagoon. Those are all kind of  book-based lecture style. Our other trainings, our skill trainings, are very little lecture, a lot of hands-on  skills. ",48:02
1120,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,226,1,Interviewer 1 ,What do you find works better? ,49:05
1117,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,226,1,Interviewee ,"Hands down, hands-on skills. Our boiler class and our electrical controls, they fill up every time, there's  wait lists. People walk out the class saying I learned something, I could do something. We get reports back.  When people go back from training, they're like, Oh, I went and did this thing in my plant that I didn't  know how to do or I was afraid to do before. I've never had someone call me excited after they, you know,  left level one training the week later be like, Yeah, I went back and I redid this thing in my plant because I  so much understand it better. That was never the case. So ",49:09
1121,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,226,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Is it hard to find people to run water plants? I mean, is there openings or turnover or is that an issue? ",49:46
1118,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,226,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, there's a high level of turnover. And it's for different reasons. Some of it is, is a salary, it doesn't pay  well in a lot of communities. Some of it is, is not being able to pass the test. There is a stigma that a lot of  operators have, when they take the test over and over and they can't pass, they feel like someone else  could do it better, even if they're a good operator. So some of that, some of it's support. I've had some  really good operators, highly skilled, just get fed up not having good support around them in the  community. When something goes wrong, it's all on them. And so they just after so long of that, just, you  know, they're done, and they move on to something else, or just be unemployed, because it's better to  be unemployed than have that stress. So ",49:59
1122,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,226,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay, so just to follow up on that a little bit, is it a good job? I mean, not just the pay thing, but I think in  the public thing, public perception, right? Are these people seen as, like in a positive light? Or is there  community support? ",51:00
1119,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,226,1,Interviewee ,"It's a great question, um, I think it can be a good job. I think most of the water plant operators deal with  more complaints. No one's like, wow, this water is great that's coming out of our faucet. But when  something comes out of their faucet that doesn't look great, they sure do say something to the operator.  So it's one of those jobs that when you're doing your job well, no one notices and no one seems to care  or know. But when you don't do your job, or something goes wrong, everybody has a comment and a  complaint. So I think that's kind of hard for the operators. And the money issue, that's a decision made  locally, right? That's a decision made locally, I have operators that make anywhere from 10/12 dollars an  hour, up to 20/30 dollars an hour. So great disparity across where they're at. Honestly, like everyone  thinks, like, increase the salary, that's the answer. One place to increase the salary. Everyone's like, Yay,  great, then they're like, oh, we can't afford this. So they cut everybody's hours. Net, the people ended up  actually losing money on the deal. And, you know, they didn't know how good operators they had. So they  burnt their operators, so their operators, turn the boilers back on. And now they've spent $15,000 in fuel  this year that they wouldn't have spent before because the operator was there and like on top of whether  the boilers needed to be on or not that day, and he would actually turn them off on days it didn't need to ",51:23
1123,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,227,1,Interviewee ,"be on. Well, now they spent more money. It wasn't a whole picture. And so yeah, operators, generally  they need to get paid well. And they need. I mean, I think really the support to know that they're doing  something good. I think most of my most of my operators that are good at their job, they care about the  position and they care about the job. And they will take less money if they get support and recognition  for what they're doing. So because they see it as a service to the community. ",51:23
1127,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,227,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And then the other thing that you mentioned was passing a test, coming in for training and then passing  a test. That's also a barrier. ",53:52
1124,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,227,1,Interviewee ,That's a huge barrier.  ,54:07
1128,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,227,1,Interviewer 1 ,Yeah. So talk to us about that. Tell us about the test. ,54:08
1125,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,227,1,Interviewee ,"So our pass rates in rural Alaska are horrible. You know, I can't remember seven to ten percent, on  average, something like that. Those are actually good pass rates for a standard class. We've done some  things lately working on some different ways to do the teaching, that have got those higher, but they're  still less than 50%. I think the highest we got was 40%. And everybody in the state thought it was  phenomenal. And that took like a crazy amount of hours into that training to get that amount of pass rate.  Most people will take this test multiple times before they pass it. We stopped doing level two tests  because most people eventually will get their level one, if they stick with it long enough. Most of them  will never pass the level two test. We have RMWs that have failed the level two test and not by a lot, by  one or 2%, multiple times. They know more about water treatment than I do. They just don't test well.  And so one of the common things we hear is ""best answer"" questions, or as they call them locally ""trick  questions"". There were trick questions on the test. Best answer questions are almost impossible for  people that English is their second language, where they don't have real solid grasp on English book  learning to understand and break down those questions to get the right answer. So then at that point,  now they're just one in 4, whether they're gonna get it right, right, because it's multiple choice, and they're  gonna stab in the dark, because they don't, they don't get actually what it's saying. A lot of these people,  if we read them the test questions, they can tell us the correct answer. But if they read it, they struggle to  get the correct answer. So it's really amazing to see a guy that can answer every question in class, come  up short on the test, every time. You're like, he's going to nail it this time, and but he just doesn't quite,  when he reads it himself, it doesn't sound the same as when I read the question in class. So. ",54:13
1129,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,227,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So I feel like I probably know the answer to this. But in terms of, is it more important that an operator, get  hands-on like on the job training, or certification and pass the test?  ",56:44
1126,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,227,1,Interviewee ,"Depends on who you ask. If you ask operator certification at DEC, they will say they need to pass their  test. It's actually become a huge issue compliance wise to have a non-certified operator, we're starting to ",57:02
1131,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,228,1,Interviewee ,"see a lot of issues in DEC, pushing on that issue. I'm pushing communities hard to get someone to pass  the test. Or my point of view, the test is irrelevant. I've had people that could pass the test, but couldn't  operate the plant. I want people that can operate the plant that can do it well. They can learn the  intricacies of their system, how to make it work. And do that every time. If they can pass the test, great. I  tell administrators like you should send them to training. It's a goal to get them to pass the test. But it's  definitely not the gold standard, how they operate their system day in and day out. That's, that's what's  important. And so, yeah. ",57:02
1134,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,228,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So if you could do anything, if you were in charge of the regulation, what would you do? What's the  answer? ",58:14
1132,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 13 ,228,1,Interviewee ,"Ah, the state has been working for years and spent several million dollars on system-specific certification.  And they have fallen short at ever getting that accomplished. So and the concept in that would be that  we have an operator that's taken the test a couple times, can't pass. Instead of them getting this huge  general test that's for the whole nation, they would get tested on specific components that they have,  and they would get certified to work in their plant, it would not be transferable to another plant. It's for  their plant. And they'd have to take several smaller tests, you know, in chunks, that would address the  components that they have and the things that they need to have. I think that is the easiest way. Just  getting that in place. And people can be certified to what they know and where they're at and we could  say yes, they're safe to operate their system. Can they go to Florida and operate a water plant? No. But  honestly, could I go to Florida and operate a water plant? I mean, I know the generals and I passed the  test, but I'm gonna be a fish out of water down there, like you know, it's not even really applicable. So I  think that's the magic wand. And we spent so much time and got nowhere. I mean, we've literally been  working on this for years. I don't remember the first time I've reviewed curriculum, but that was like, easily  12 years ago. And we still don't have it in place. Several contractors that have been paid to build it, the  state, like killed the project multiple times, they've never got a finished product. ",58:24
1154,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,232,2,Interviewer 1 ,"[REDACTED] So we'll start a little bit set the background. You mentioned just before that, you've been  about [REDACTED] years, and now you're in school, right? Hopefully, that's going. Going well? ",00:00

1151,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,232,2,Interviewee ,I got hired and started working for the [REDACTED] and yah got experience working with water plants and  the clinics out here. So jumped on that. ,01:54

1152,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,232,2,Interviewee ,"Yeah, so I wanted to live remote. I knew from working with the or having an internship with the  [REDACTED]. After well, during college, I had to take an internship, I took it with the [REDACTED] the  remote lifestyle. I had a teacher mentor in at [REDACTED] that led me in this direction, I thought it'd be a  good fit for me, knowing my lifestyle and what I wanted to do with it. And he led me in this direction. And  applied for the position. [REDACTED] had an interview with me. And yeah, things just kind of evolved into  taking the position and moving out to Alaska sight unseen. Never been to the state before and just  dropped me and [REDACTED]. Been good to me ever since. ",02:17
1158,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,232,2,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, it seems like it's funny. People in that situation end up making it a year or they are there their whole  life. There's not much in the middle. Yeah. And your degree is in [REDACTED]. ",03:15

1162,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,233,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay. All right. Is there any other? You mentioned an internship? Is there any other education? Or training  that you feel like is relevant? Training, formal or informal? How did you learn to do what you do? Or did? ",03:32
1159,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,233,1,Interviewee ,"Well, there's definitely classes, you know, that dealt with very lower 48 water plants and other types of  air quality. They're, yeah, they're lower 48. I mean, you're when you learn about these water plants there  for hundreds of 1000s of people, and not just a small community of 3 to 700 people, maybe 1000 or 2000.  So learning the basics of water quality happened that way. But when I came here, it was mostly on-site  training. A lot of the like, the first or second week we got here, we I was a part of training water plant  operators. So I was learning it and they were learning it pretty much. I was just I was reading it pretty  much right before and doing my best to teach. And for air quality, some of the projects we've done in the  past. It's not really guided to that so I'm gonna skip that. Yeah, for water plants, mostly just following the  remote maintenance workers and completing trainings with water plant operators. ",03:47
1163,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,233,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Who was that when you started with, is that? Was that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]? Or did you do you  start when you said you started? You're right in the in the class, water plant operator class? [REDACTED]  right away? ",04:57
1160,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,233,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. So [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] was leading the class to start off with. And at that time remote, we  were all kind of pitching in, remote maintenance workers would come from their respective villages. That  would probably be, I believe [REDACTED] might have been there, and [REDACTED], and I'm not sure if  [REDACTED] came in, but he's a part of it also. And I think we hired [REDACTED] after, so I don't think he  was there for my first training.  ",05:12
1164,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,233,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay, great. So how, you mentioned operator training? How, what ways have you worked with water  infrastructure? ",05:42
1161,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,233,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, so the opposite, or in my position, we usually survey water plants for the state need every three  years. And so with me working through that, I've had to learn the water systems, I follow remote  maintenance workers in the water plants and learn from them. Along with the water plant operators, they  teach me what's going on in their plant, I fill out the survey, and I turn it into the state. For actual on hand,  me turning dials or adding chemicals to water plants. I don't have experience with water, drinking water  treatment, [REDACTED].  ",05:53
1165,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,233,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So going out to villages and doing water plant inspections, because they're required every three years,  how much of that? What was your relationship with the operators there, or the tribes or the or the  community when you were visiting those places? ",06:52
1166,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,234,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, so over the years, I've been able to make some relationships, often, many communities have a  revolving door in their administrative positions or within the water plant operator position. So sometimes  they'll stick around. And sometimes they're still around and over the [REDACTED] years, but for the most  part, even administrators that were there for longer periods of time, COVID kind of pushed everyone out  the door to just the stresses of life, and they didn't want to deal with it for what they could deal with  before it's become too much. So feel, this pandemic has really made it difficult for the water plant  operator or for the administrators that were around to stick around. But yeah, it's really hard to have  plans and set budgets and have. And this is important because of the bigger picture of like best practice  scores with the state and how they fund water plant projects. So it's hard to stay on track with a plan if  they have a plan to stay on track, and get the necessary paperwork in and correct or had the correct type  of paperwork filled out to fit their needs. So yeah, and for the water plant operators, it can kind of be a  revolving door. Also. Some water plants have them for a long period of time, and I'm still talking to the  same guy I was talking to [REDACTED] years ago, pretty rare. Some guys will be gone for a couple years  and come back because it kind of by default, they don't really know who else can run the water plant and  they are in need of a job again. Or, yeah, they just find anyone and for the most part, they just get docked  points when it comes to best practice because people don't keep their certificates and the certificates are  kind of they're pretty difficult to obtain. They're the accreditation system is really geared towards people  in the lower 48. And with water systems that I learned of the style of running them in college rather than  what's actually in Alaska. So you get asked questions about huge baffles and all these systems that Yeah,  I mean, we don't have this here. Yeah. ",07:10
1169,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,234,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And I probably have some more questions on that a little farther and specifically is that certification issue  because that's been mentioned as a challenge. That, you know, we were, we were expecting to hear  about. I did want to dig just you said something interesting to me about you know, it being a revolving  door. Do you feel like on your side though, having been there for [REDACTED] years, even if the person  you're working with, how do you feel, how do you feel that affects your credibility going into a village? Or  your comfort level? Right? Like, is it like, people recognize you still as somebody who's been there? Or  when that water plant operator switches, or the tribal admin switches, Is it? Are you really starting from  scratch? ",09:32
1167,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,234,1,Interviewee ,"I feel often it is starting from scratch. And even so with what I do with the water plants, [REDACTED] ",10:17
1170,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,234,1,Interviewer 1 ,"okay, all right. Yeah, ",10:24
1168,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,234,1,Interviewee ,"um, so yeah, with when it's easier when you have that relationship with the water plant operator or the  administrator and them knowing what you do for them and how to reach out to you and what I can help  them with versus at least how I can guide them in the right direction. When you have a new administrator,  often, they don't know who you are, if you did have a business card on their desk at some point, they  removed it at some point. So it's constantly you're constantly introducing yourself to new people. So it's  hard to make a lot of progress with the community relationships. ",10:25
1173,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,235,1,Interviewer 1 ,"[REDACTED], so the environmental health officers do all kinds of stuff. And then this water is sort of one  piece of it. Great. Um, and talking about, you know, so we talked about the water plant operators, talked  about the tribal administrators, do you ever talk to the public? [REDACTED] Do you ever talk about water  with people? ",11:07
1171,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,235,1,Interviewee ,"Yes, occasionally, very occasionally, it comes up, I feel a lot of people are pretty set in their ways to how  they think about water, and water quality and what they think about their water plant operators or their  water source. In this area, you know [REDACTED], that a lot of people really rely on traditional sources for  water, they'd rather drink water from the river often, and they would rather go to a to go to haul water  from their water plant. Even if it is the same distance or even closer, they would rather still go to a river  to do so they think that it is safer. Because traditionally, that's what their people have done for hundreds  of years. 1000s of years. ",11:43
1174,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,235,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Is that a? Is that a touchy subject? I mean, or is it? Is it easy to talk to people about that? Or is that  something that's kind of like talking about politics? ",12:28
1172,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,235,1,Interviewee ,"Kind of like talking about politics. Yeah, some things have happened over the years, like, especially thinking  of fluoride in the past with I believe it was [REDACTED] where, you know, you get a pretty bad rep on  fluoride and in fluoride in water, and then [REDACTED] hears it, and now it's because people have died  from it. Fluoride is bad, and fluoride will always probably be bad, unless there's a mass change of mind.  Not really sure how, how to do that we get I know, along [REDACTED]. Yeah, constant teaching of what  fluoride really is, safe levels, and how it benefits the human body and how we have such tooth decay in  this area and how it can really improve the health of children. It just doesn't get through to the right  people. Or it will not change your minds. It's kind of the same with chlorine. And people think adding more  chlorine will be worse for them. Because they can smell like, oh, I can smell it with a little bit. If I put more,  I'm just going to smell it more, which is not the case. So with the breaking point, so yeah, I've had water  plant operators that have worked for me that I've taught them that, you know, I've explained to them,  you need to hit this point, like, this is what you need to do. I've had people in class, argue with me about  it, even as I'm teaching them and showing them and like people that they respect, such as their remote  maintenance workers are telling them also like, you need to do this for this purpose and to really clean  the water. But it doesn't always get through. I don't know exactly how to change your minds if they're not  open to receiving information.  ",12:36
1175,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,235,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So that's interesting, that must put water plant operators in an awkward spot sometimes. Right? I mean,  because they I mean they live in the community. Is there do you see them as being advocates or how are  they perceived and how do they deal with that stress? ",14:38
1176,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,236,1,Interviewee ,"Good question. I'm someone who doesn't work in the village. And here there are people that complain to  the village about what goes on. I only hear a fraction or a tiny bit of what actually comes up, people aren't  really open to sharing difficult situations out here that they may deal with. So from what I have heard,  and when I do ask people about their water quality, they'll be like, Oh, I don't drink from there anyways,  because of whatever reason. Maybe you can just ask me the question one more time, I got lost in a train  of thought. ",14:55
1180,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,236,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I just I was thinking about the water plant operators, and if they're comfortable talking to the public, or if  they are like, kind of like the tax man, nobody wants to see him or are they like? Are they a trusted source?  Or are they on board with it? I mean, or they just need a job? ",15:34
1177,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,236,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I think a lot of them just need a job. They're not in that position to talk to the public to Nice job  where they can be inside a water plant and work with their hands. That's a big part of it. This culture isn't  necessarily super outspoken. So it's pretty rare if you get somebody that can speak out and reach people  in that way. So especially with water plant operators, if they don't, they didn't get the job because they  wanted to lead or be leaders of the public and be educators. They wanted a job and water plant operator.  Yeah, there's not a lot of jobs. So water plant operator was kind of like something they could be. ",15:52
1181,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,236,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Do you feel like they're, do you feel like they get like bad, are there negative feelings about water plant  operators? I mean, is it, or indifferent? ",16:31
1178,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,236,1,Interviewee ,"It might be indifferent, depending on community and location, or community and the Yeah, where they  are. Okay. ",16:43
1182,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,236,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Well, I went off course a little bit, but that was interesting to me. How so you live in [REDACTED], but you  work you have like a probably a set of a set of villages that you've had or have you been all over the place? ",16:54
1179,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,236,1,Interviewee ,"I've been all over the place but and have been way more communities and I cover I cover [REDACTED]  communities throughout [REDACTED]. So I had to travel to every single one at least once a year for, I  would say [REDACTED] years, but at this point, probably more like [REDACTED] because of COVID. So I've  been to all of my communities at least [REDACTED]. ",17:09
1183,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,236,1,Interviewer 1 ,Yeah. How? How is water? How do people get water? ,17:37
1184,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,237,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. I have a lot of the more poor communities, I feel. Most of my communities do not have pipe water  to their houses. Most of them either have a co-water system going to explain that or is that a common  knowledge for this? ",17:43
1188,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,237,1,Interviewer 1 ,Why don't you go ahead? ,18:01
1185,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,237,1,Interviewee ,"So with a co-water system, the home owner generally has to haul their own water by four wheeler or  snow machine with it what is generally a 30 gallon trash can that they only use for water. And they will  drive their four wheeler or snow machine over to the water plant. Sometimes they have to pay a few  quarters, sometimes it's tokens that they would buy over at the tribal or city office, and they'd fill up their  bucket, they drive back to their house, they would have to have a pump, then that can pump it into their  water tank, their drinking water tank, where then it can be used for washing or flushing. And at that point,  it would go into their sewer tank and that would have to be evacuated at some point. Generally the water  entity also has a sewer entity and they would pump that out and take it to the lagoon and they would  dismiss it there. And for other communities that they do not have co-water systems. They just get drinking  water from wherever. Some of them like I said, think that it's healthier to get from the river or local water  source. There's one or two communities that might have a spring where they get collect water from but  most I would say get from a river. Most community members probably get from the river, rainwater. I  mean, people say sometimes that people melt ice I haven't really seen it too much. But for the most part,  just those three the rain, river water and going over to the water plant and collecting the same way and  taking it home. ",18:04
1189,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,237,1,Interviewer 1 ,Do you have do you have any communities that don't have access to treated water? ,19:56
1263,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,248,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. [REDACTED], you want to jump in with water plant operator stuff? I know we're running a little short  on time here. ",1:00:37
1266,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,248,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah, yeah. I was hoping, can you expand a little bit about kind of what training do you think would be  useful? So kind of maybe stepping away from certification more towards? Is it on the job training? Is it  with the remote maintenance worker program? What have you seen as successful? And what do you think  you need to, for it to be more successful? ",1:00:47
1267,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,249,1,Interviewee ,"Either on the job, or hands-on training, I think is most beneficial. We have people super eager to learn in  classes that aren't necessarily water plant, super directed. But our boiler maintenance and repair program  had been one of the things that water plant operators can come to help their water plants. It's not  something they're gonna like, oh, this goes towards water plant operator, this, maybe it does get they get  some a couple CEUs towards what they have. But that's a class where, yeah, they might lecture for four  hours. But then after that, it's like, this is how you troubleshoot this boiler. This is how it works. And you  get guys working together, working with their hands, things that they like to do. This area, everybody  works with their hands, even if you don't want to work with your hands. To save money, or because  somebody's not going to do it for you, unless you pay them a ton of money. Yeah. We learn to work with  our hands by necessity, not because of choice. So, um, yeah, in classes like that boiler class, you see people  eager, you see people excited, you see people wanting to learn. Or that yeah, there was a pumps class  that happened that some guys from [REDACTED] came to teach at one time, they were people were really  excited and want to learn, it was a lot of things that were hands-on where they could touch and feel and  tighten and put pipes together by soldering them or screw it and stuff like that. And that becomes  beneficial. Same with electrical controls, where we have a, we have these, like these fake systems that,  you know, if they burn out, if they were to like, be like a very minor shock, or if they were to like burn a  circuit that the circuit would actually burn out. And they'd have to replace it. Those are the classes where  it's hands on troubleshooting something that they see useful, and they see something that they actually  can touch and hold and see beneficial to them, rather than just taking the test so they can have a  certificate on their wall when they already do that job. ",1:01:08
1270,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,249,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah, yeah. And so in terms of so you said you've done a lot of operator training. That's mainly focused  on ""Okay, we're gonna try to pass the exam"", correct?  ",1:03:25
1268,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,249,1,Interviewee ,Yeah.  ,1:03:36
1271,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,249,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Okay. Yeah. Because it's connected to funding right, and things like that. Okay. That makes sense. And  then, let me. And then what about I guess, from your perspective? Um, were you ever trained to train  others, right? Like, were you ever trained on this? This piece of your job? ",1:03:37
1269,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,249,1,Interviewee ,"Not really, there was one training [REDACTED] that happened like [REDACTED] years ago, and then COVID  happened. So we haven't really been able to put that into action. But there were many entities throughout  the state that were trying to figure out the training problem that there is, and how to better engage our  students. And yeah, I think that was put on by the state led by [REDACTED], I want to say, and there have  been some people like [REDACTED], they've really been able to put that into action. I feel some and,  [REDACTED] that have been able to do more online educational classes geared toward the exam. It's just,  it's going to be geared to the exam. It's a piece of paper that they need to say that they did it for the state.  Yeah, yeah. ",1:04:02
1274,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,250,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So do you think about online training? I mean, for any of this obviously, hands-on isn't going to be is there  is there a place for it? I mean, ",1:04:50
1272,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,250,1,Interviewee ,"I think there can be a place for it. I think online training, even when I have to do it, I don't like it. I, I prefer  to be in person, I prefer to touch things I learned with by doing and repeatedly doing. With COVID, you  know, everything's kind of gone towards being online. But the times that I learned the most is when I'm  in person with hands on. So I think it can become very difficult with other people in the area that might  think likewise with learning. Also, I mean, we have the problem of having enough internet and having fast  enough internet, I mean, internet's probably been decent right now, for me, but it was the beginning of  the month, it just started over, I still have plenty of gigs left to use for the Zoom call, and for whatever  else I need. But there are definitely connection issues. And the price of Internet is a luxury. It's extremely  expensive here. Yeah. And yeah, you, you have a zoom call with somebody in the village. I mean, if they're  able to connect and knowing what's going on, they don't have like, often a well running computer within  a water plant where they can just be like, Hey, what's going on, let me do this training here. Half the time,  they don't know what's going on with that either. Or if they go to the office, it's kind of the same deal  where it's this, it's not their computer, it's not something they're familiar with. Yeah, having somebody  talk at them isn't necessarily something that they're, they learn how to do within their family, a lot of it,  when they learn is to watch somebody do it. And I don't know, whether it be like cutting moose, or cutting  fish, it's just a lot of pointing and kind of like grunt maybe and like watching somebody, and then like, kind  of just like watching how they hold their hand and what they do and how like, and then like, I don't know,  I've had like a fur sewing class. And I had, I was trying to ask a elder a question. And she's like, No, like  this, and just physically show me rather than, so when you do, and this is what you're doing wrong. And  you need to do it like this so that it can be better. It's a no. And then just you have to watch and do it. And  kind of, since I didn't grow up in this lifestyle, it's something that I've had to get used to. But a lot of it's  through visual and hands on. Yeah. So with it being online, I mean, there's you lose that whole aspect of  the hands on. And visual is often somebody talking at you about something that we're trying to describe  that they may have never looked at before. Like here are these molecules that you can't touch and how  do you explain how it kills them, or the disinfectant will kill them? So that's a really good insight about the  I mean, I've been that person learning to cut fish and being grunted at that's a really good insight. Yeah, ",1:04:58
1276,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,250,1,Interviewer 2 ,"yeah. So a lot of what you're talking about too, is just like different ways of learning and figuring out how  to bring those together. Right. And, Okay, interesting. Awesome. I know, we're hitting at the end of time  so [REDACTED]. Are there any? ",1:07:58
1275,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,250,1,Interviewer 1 ,"You know, I don't think so. I wanted to see if you had anything that you thought we should have asked  you? Do you have anything else to cover? Or you have any questions for us? ",1:08:12
1273,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,250,1,Interviewee ,Thank you guys for doing this study. [REDACTED] ,1:08:25
1186,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,237,1,Interviewee ,"Don't have access, what is your definition? ",20:07
1190,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,237,1,Interviewer 1 ,Like there's not a watering point or there's not a functional water treatment? Or maybe there's a boil  water notice? ,20:10
1187,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,237,1,Interviewee ,"Yes, there. I mean, right now, there's a couple probably that have that going on. But one of them that I  can think of off the top of my mind has a pipe water system, they've just had issues keeping it running  [REDACTED]. Had some problems with freezing, and the system kind of crashing on them. So rather than  listening, well I know too much. Rather than listening to the, their remote maintenance worker, they kind  of decided to take things into what they thought was appropriate, and put their system more in danger  by you know, maybe yeah, risk of burning down of their motors that, you know, now were running dry,  because water isn't running through them, without enough pressure in the water system to be able to  pressurize pumps and have water running through them. But I mean, I suspect by now that should ",20:17
1191,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,238,1,Interviewee ,"hopefully be changed [REDACTED]. As I know, the remote maintenance worker was working with them  since [REDACTED]. ",20:17
1196,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,238,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So but so you do work with I mean, if a community member asked you, you do have communities where  you can't you couldn't tell somebody that they have access to safe like safe water to water you could put  a stamp on. Is that Is that accurate? ",21:26
1192,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,238,1,Interviewee ,"Maybe just one community and at this point, I think it should be good. But yeah.  ",21:47

1193,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,238,1,Interviewee ,"Or sorry. So. So for some communities that might not have a community drinking water system, they  might have a school that has a that they can buy water from as well. So I'm thinking specifically  [REDACTED], where they're in the process of having a community water system. I don't know if they  started building yet or not. But when you say access to it, like technically, they can get it from the school  if they want to get it from the school. But that's kind of like a not necessarily community water system.  It's a private water system. ",21:56
1198,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,238,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I mean, people could fly in bottled water too I guess. Yeah. Yeah. And I think I mean, I think [REDACTED]  was on a boil water notice for years, right? ",22:32
1194,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,238,1,Interviewee ,"I mean, [REDACTED] doesn't have a water system so I don't know what they have boil water notice for? ",22:42
1199,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,238,1,Interviewer 1 ,Have you in the time that you've been there? How have you seen how have you seen things change in  terms of getting water to people how things change over time. ,22:51
1195,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,238,1,Interviewee ,"Occasionally, they have systems being built, I mean, they're very expensive system funding is very difficult  to come by having the communities have the proper amount of points to get a water system built for  them can be very difficult when the entity cannot make money to begin with a lot of their scored points  on their best practice from the state has to do with financial keeping and their ways of making money.  And, you know, you can't really make points in sections with, with a water plant if you don't have a water  plant. And having. Yep, so not having an entity also puts you at a disadvantage, because you can't really  collect money from people when it comes to that. So yeah, and the only thing that it might rely on if the  entity owns it would be the power and maybe a store. And it's yeah, it's hard to have a good financial  standing with the limited resources in a village. ",23:05
1205,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,239,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So overall, if you were thinking about the [REDACTED] years that you've been there, would you say that  on average for the communities you work with things have improved or things have gotten worse or things  have stayed the same? ",24:13
1200,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,239,1,Interviewee ,"I would say many have stayed the same. Maybe one or two okay. Well, it's, you know, [REDACTED] years  within the time period of water plants. I think it's very small. But there have been one or two communities  that have projects taking role here so like [REDACTED] has something coming in. But you know, they  couldn't get a project started. Without the, you know, the tragedy of the water plant catching fire. Now  it's an emergency now things can get put into motion. They were one of those communities that their  <inaudible> score was never going to get higher than what it was, no matter how hard they tried. Whether  it be because of turnover in their office or. Yeah, I mean, water plants can sometimes be a pit if you don't  have if you don't have pipe water to everyone's house.  ",24:28
1206,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,239,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay. So can you tell us? Can you share with us an anecdote, a recent moment or story that made you  aware of challenges and local water infrastructure? Like pretend you're talking to someone from  [REDACTED], and you want to tell a story? We do this all the time. Right when people come out to visit? ",25:39

1207,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,239,1,Interviewer 1 ,right. Or school reunions? Right? Were you involved with the [REDACTED] thing at all? ,26:06
1202,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,239,1,Interviewee ,"No, I was pretty removed. But back when their water plant was running. About [REDACTED] years ago.  They were having some issues with their filter. And they needed new. I don't really know if this is  answering your question now. So Okay. ",26:27
1208,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,239,1,Interviewer 1 ,Something that involved a challenge. ,26:51
1203,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,239,1,Interviewee ,Repeat the question one more time. ,26:58
1209,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,239,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Oh, it's just a story, or a time and experience that made you aware of infrastructure challenges. You  mentioned kind of like when you were new too, how it was maybe a different situation than you learned  about in school, or most of us have some of those moments where you're like, Whoa. ",27:00
1204,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,239,1,Interviewee ,There's so many it's just kind of normal at this point. ,27:26
1212,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,240,1,Interviewer 1 ,I know. That's why we asked that question. ,27:28
1210,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,240,1,Interviewee ,"I don't know. I guess like just learning about fluoride and how people were so against it here was kind of  like eye opening to me that one incident at this point must be like [REDACTED] years ago, that continues  to resonate throughout the communities of how fluoride has a negative impact on human health, rather  than the positive impact that it can create. So I can specifically remember just in class, having one of the  water plant operators who was very against it. Kind of rolled his eyes and had to speak out wanted to  speak out against fluoride in the class and how it is negative and just having to teach people that within  safe measures. And when the state measures aren't removed. Like this, the safeguards are removed, that  it can be healthy and it can benefit human health. Especially the health of children that are losing teeth.  Yeah. So yeah, just trying to convince a class that, you know, this water plant operator was pretty highly  respected within the community, his community for sure. But also throughout [REDACTED] as one of the  more experienced operators that he's worked there for so long. It's kind of has you know, everything's all  about what family what name where you're from around here. And when you have like, I'm just some  new guy coming in from [REDACTED]. I don't know anything. I don't they don't know me. I have no family  here. Why would they listen to me? Trying to convince somebody, that's where my struggle was, is I'm  teaching them something out of a book, rather than what they have seen with their own eyes or  something that they've been told from, you know, story to story or from elder to elder, so on and so forth  when it comes to how stories are exchanged in this area. Being the outsider can be very difficult.  ",27:30
1213,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,240,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Great. So pivoting a little bit talking about infrastructure challenges, you know, we talked some about the  people and the training. Can you tell us a little bit about physical challenges? There's like a fire in  [REDACTED], obviously. What kind of physical challenges does water delivery face? ",27:55
1211,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,240,1,Interviewee ,"Well, the temperature for sure, whenever it drops, you know, it's been Yeah, especially this winter, winter  fall, we had about a month of double negatives, and then warmed up to like [REDACTED] and just rained  the whole time. When the weather drops for a long period of time, it becomes very difficult for water  plants to be to sustain water in their water tanks. Because to prevent water from freezing, many  community members will run their faucets and it will drain the tanks just so that they can continue to  have a defrosted water line. So that's one thing, the weather. If they need chemicals or supplies or fuel,  they have to make it within for fuel they have to make you have to put enough money aside to have bulk  fuel sent to them throughout the summer, where it's cheapest to send in fuel through a barge all the way  from I'm guessing [REDACTED] is where they buy it from and it gets shipped all the way around, it comes  all the way [REDACTED] and barged up like in past [REDACTED] and wherever they else need to go up  through [REDACTED] or whether it be [REDACTED] or wherever it is that their water plants are. So fuel  can be difficult especially with having to secure enough fuel for the whole community and the water plant.  Challenges of shipping chemicals or parts can be very difficult not only, it's not like Amazon where in the  Lower 48, you can get it in like two days or even same day. You know, if they even happen to have it in  [REDACTED], which is pretty rare. Whatever they're looking for, it has to get from [REDACTED], to often ",30:09
1214,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,241,1,Interviewee ,"[REDACTED], then get on a small plane and hopefully the weather's good. And everything lines up just  right, you're looking at seven to 10 days before you can get a missing part that you needed or something  broken if you don't have it on hand. And we're talking about like regular non pandemic issues, or like good  weather issues for it to get shipped out. Even if you did ship it priority as much as you can. Yeah, it can be  very difficult. Occasionally, there have been times where it was a really pressing part or something like  that where myself or water plant operators can take a snow machine or a boat and drop it off to them at  their water plant. But that is also something that's yeah, it's something we can do at times. But it's not  always possible with weather or what's going on in everyone's schedule, or how large the object is or if  it's worth taking a ride out for a $20 part but often we do it anyway just to help the community out but it  is something that travel is a challenge. ",30:09
1217,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,241,1,Interviewer 1 ,So there's the issue of not being able to make water and not being able to get water to people. How about  water quality? ,33:16
1215,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,241,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, for water quality many times as long as you follow what directions you're given to run the water  plants can be good. But as long as they have a well. Often wells, from what I understand, aren't dug deep  enough for the best water quality is often found within where they are in the community. Oh often water  has arsenic already in it and they have to treat to get the arsenic out. They're usually at lower levels but  still no arsenic is better. And when it comes to surface water systems during the spring and fall when  water inverts, water quality changes and it becomes difficult for the water plants to be able to treat the  water because of either be more turbidity, more contaminant. Yeah, during that time, places such as  [REDACTED] can only draw water in during the summer, for the most part, and then they have you know,  their pond freezes over. And they can't get water from their water source. So they fill up I think, three  large water tanks. I don't remember how big they are at this time, but that's the water that they have for  the year. So they have to, you have to work to fill those up. But also they can have issues in that area since  they're close to the ocean with brackish water and how to deal with that.  ",33:25
1218,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,241,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So it sounds as though some of that is sort of regulatory quality. And some of it is like secondary  characteristics. Right? And it sounds like, sounds like a mix of the two issues, right? Or ",35:03
1216,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,241,1,Interviewee ,"It can be two issues. Yeah, but I mean, if you have enough NTU people aren't gonna want to drink it  anyways, it you know, we see we see in drink with our eyes, often, rather than what water quality is, if  you go to a restaurant, we're like, oh, I have flakes in my water, whether or not it has enough water or  chlorine or whatever. To keep it clean, we would probably send it back. Just because we see with our eyes,  and we don't want to put something into our body that looks unhealthy. Yeah, most of it can be like  secondary contaminants, where they're not technically a health issue. Most of the time, yeah, it is like,  even here in [REDACTED], some of it some of its people's own water systems, or their own water tanks,  but living on the water system, or on the pipe water system for a bit. A few years back. Yeah, you know,  if you fill up a pitcher of water, you're going to have some turbidity in it. It's just what it is. But working  for the water plants and knowing what is going on with the water, I didn't have a problem drinking it. But ",35:16
1219,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,242,1,Interviewee ,"often people would use a second or you know, another type of filter at home, you're often using Brita  filters to take out the contaminants or Berkys or whatever it is that they wanted to use. Also have it in our  area, we're more fortunate to have systems set up where we will use a cartridge filter to take out some  more of that iron or turbidity that might be in the water just for water that we use to clean our bodies  with and like, just because we don't want to see we don't want to get cleaned with brown water or Yeah,  help us after clean the showers as many times because it's building up filth.

Yeah, I know, that's  been an issue in [REDACTED] where the, you know, the city's been very adamant that the water is safe to  drink. But there's still a lot of concerns about, you know, like, look at this water and tell me I'm supposed  to drink this. ",36:49

Seasonally,  what do you think about changes, like climate change, like long term changes? Is that does that affect the  infrastructure? Or have you seen ways that it has? ",37:53
1221,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,242,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I want to circle back to your first part there since something I didn't mention. Areas such as  [REDACTED], that do have pipe water systems, often, depending on the systems that they have set up for  them have a with a changing of the seasons, they have their water lines propped up on, like stilts, they're  different types of however, they support their water, water lines, they heave and go up and down and  can cause breaks and pipes and stuff like that, to where it can become difficult with the seasons changing  constantly have to be monitored, and, and changed up and down requires a lot of hands to keep that  system running.

1222,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,242,1,Interviewee ,"Right. So um, I think like the thing that's most in the news right now would be [REDACTED]. [REDACTED].  Yeah, you can see that the erosion caused it's, yeah, it's eating away. I don't know how many feet per year ",39:10
1228,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,243,1,Interviewee ,"at this point. But I think when it first started, it was like [REDACTED] feet a year of their banks are getting  eroded. And at this point, it's so close to the school, or they've been planning to move the school for many  years and they're still working on trying to do that. With it being so close to the bank. It's crazy going there  and like seeing how much has changed. And yeah, I mean, I drive a boat during the summer. I pass through  there at least a couple times a year and you can park in one spot and not be able to park there the next  time you pass by just because of how much the land erodes. Yeah, definitely caused by permafrost and  freezing, but also a lot of the, a lot of the changes in the environment have caused for what I kind of feel  like more, more storms. It hit specifically really hard in that on their banks there. Yeah, we had a pretty  rainy summer this year, which is pretty. I mean, it can you know, everything changes here and there, but  it's a really rainy summer. It's a lot of storms. And it really hit [REDACTED] really hard with the how much  erosion was caused. ",39:10
1232,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,243,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Does that put water plants or pipes or haul? Trails? I mean, does it put those things? Are those things in  danger? From that, or has it had effect on that? ",40:50
1229,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,243,1,Interviewee ,"With this community? Specifically, I feel like probably more of a school problem at the moment. But I  mean, the water plants right behind the school, or like parts of the water plant are right behind the school.  And in other areas. Yeah, I mean, with [REDACTED], specifically, houses have had to be moved from their  bank where they're also experiencing erosion. And pipes have had to be rerouted to those houses once  they have moved their houses. I mean, it's talking about moving houses. I mean, that's a big deal. Yeah,  they're, you know, on stilts, or whatnot, or propped up, but moving house is no small task. And then again,  re-piping their water system in a different way to continue water service to those houses. Right. And  especially in the small communities that you're talking about. I mean, [REDACTED] people, I mean. ",41:05
1233,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,243,1,Interviewer 1 ,"There's not five guys that know how to do this. You know, how to re-pipe a house, there's no guy, right?  You probably. ",42:04

1235,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,243,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So if you could, what do you if we're talking about just prioritizing, right? In your in your view? What do  you think is the most important challenge to fix for water infrastructure? If you could? Like if you could  wave a wand and fix it? What what's your number one? ",42:27
1236,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,244,1,Interviewee ,"I think speaking specifically with health, just getting more water to community members, and with that,  pipes would be the best way to do so. It's been proven everywhere. And that's why every state has it. Or  every other with infrastructure, the pipes are the best way to go. Having pipes to houses gets the water  to the public the most efficiently. And yeah, turning on a faucet is so much easier than running down to  the water plant and picking up water or running down to the river or chipping a hole in the ice. You try to  get water or maybe you have a formula that works maybe you don't, maybe you have a snow machine  that works, maybe you don't. Often these tasks are given to children and you know, it can be very difficult  for them to try to do this in a safe clean manner or physical. So yeah, just having water pipe to their houses  would I think benefit the public the most. ",42:56
1239,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,244,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So as sort of a side question. I've been asking [REDACTED] people, and I know you've been on piped water  and on hauled water. So if somebody was moving, if [REDACTED] here is going to move to [REDACTED]  and she was looking for a place to live, what would you tell her? What advice would you give her about  water in [REDACTED]? ",43:54
1237,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,244,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I would say overall, and I've gotten I may have spoken out of term here and there with a couple  people but especially travelers coming in. With people complaining about water quality, I would tell them  that it's safe. If they wanted to not believe me and they wanted to actually check instead of complaining  that they should look on the city site and look for their Consumer Confidence Report. And they can read  through there that the water quality is safe to drink. And if they had any aesthetic issues with it that they  can use a filter if they so pleased. But if they had like a water tank that had flakes in it? Well, it's kind of  like, if you're going to move into a place, you should probably check that out and clean it out yourself. No  one's going to do it for you. There isn't like a service, for the most part that somebody is going to come  and clean your personal water tank for you. But for the pipe system, yeah, it's safe. And it's safe to drink.  When you get your water that comes whenever you have it set up?  ",44:20

On the pipe water  system, if you can find something on the pipe water system. It's available. I mean, that's the goal for me,  right? I like I love to live on the water system at some point. Most of the, there aren't like new subdivisions  being made with that are going to be piped that I'm aware of at this time. They're further out of the  community. And they're branching out, rather than, than planning to make them with pipe water into the  houses. So they're going to continue to have the hauled water to their house. ",45:42

1248,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,245,1,Interviewer 2 ,"And I have a follow up question, too, as well, kind of going back to when you were talking about, when  you'd wave the magic wand, right? You want all these communities to be able to have a piped system.  And with kind of what you've been talking about isolation, cost, of these systems? I've heard a lot of  people talk about kind of these decentralized systems, whether it's a PASS system, I was wondering if you  could just share a little bit of your thoughts on like, if you think those are solutions, or do you think they  won't provide kind of the quality that's needed to actually serve these communities? And quantity?  ",46:58
1245,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,245,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I think their method of claiming that people are served, I don't think those systems are sustainable.  They get put into houses, there often isn't a system set up for communities to either provide services to  those people. If something breaks down, or something burns out, or something like that. Most community  members don't know how to fix those things on their own. Or are not going to fix those things on her own.  There's been an exception here and there. Maybe I don't work with these communities, maybe was it  [REDACTED], that [REDACTED] helped set up a system to where like, I'm going to train you on a few small  things. This is how you fix this; this is how you fix that, have a couple of these parts in your store. Have a  couple of these at the at the city or tribal office, you're the guy that's going to go around when somebody  complains about something and go around and fix it. Whether or not those I mean, we're talking about  systems that what maybe 200 gallons of water, 100 gallons of water, I mean, you can run the faucet  [REDACTED] and not worry like, I mean, yeah, when I go, the first thing I do when I leave here is take a  really long shower, whether it be in a hotel or family's house, like a huge long shower, I don't hear this,  run it hot and run it long. Have a bath or somewhere like it's really nice. That's like luxury of it. But also,  we're not worried about how much water we're going to use for washing so that we can wash  appropriately. I don't have to worry about, you don't have to worry about so much of like washing clothes,  or like not washing clothes. You're not worried about, you can drink as much as you want. You can clean  as much as you want. I kind of forgot where I was going. ",47:32
1254,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,246,1,Interviewer 2 ,That makes sense. So kind of just the a lot about the quantity of water as well. Right? ,49:33
1249,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,246,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, sorry. Quantity. Yeah, and the, if the system does have somebody that can go around fill up water  tanks, it becomes very expensive for a service. [REDACTED], there's a standard service, be it depending  on where you live and then how many gallons of water you're going to have filled up in your water tank.  So it becomes very expensive over time. I mean, yeah, per month, back when I used to live in a very small  house. And I only had a [REDACTED] gallon water tank that I would get filled up once a week, which even  that was kind of a luxury to have. Yeah, it was just shy of [REDACTED]. I mean, a decent paying job and  being able to do that was a luxury. Yeah. And yeah, there's other people that rely on three to maybe 100  gallons per week. If they can, if that. And the standard. The standard is like 24 per person. 24 gallons for  was it 24 gallons per person per day? At like minimum? Yeah. So it's, but most people use 100, everywhere  else, gallons per day per person. So when you really started to see those health benefits is when you can  have more water, and we're talking about 30 gallons to one house, maybe a day, maybe? And that would  be Yeah, I bet that that does not happen. Yeah. That might be like a week or whenever? ",49:38

1252,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,246,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So, circling back a little bit. They're looking at, I guess, workforce. Right. So we talked about water plant  operators, and in training, some of these things, you know, I think you kind of hit on. Communication  challenges or sort of, I don't know how to describe it sort of status or credibility issues and how  communication and credibility is formed. You mentioned how fluoride I think was, you know, one of the  big examples you use, like, how do you convince somebody that doesn't want to listen to you? I mean,  how do you do that? What's been successful? What's been successful? What's helped you? Where are  you still seeing those challenges? ",51:18
1250,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,246,1,Interviewee ,"Having like, having community meetings, having their community members that are respected, speak up  and say what needs to be done. Yeah, but you have to have somebody on board within their community  that's well respected. Without that, you're just going to be going in circles. ",52:19
1253,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,246,1,Interviewer 1 ,"What do you think would help you get there? I mean, is funding or, you know, what, like, what? What  would are there are the things you see that are missing that could help you get to improve that situation?  Is it a money problem? Is it other problems? ",52:43
1251,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,246,1,Interviewee ,"I don't think it's money. It may be education. Understanding science or chemistry, I believe, can be very  difficult for populations where school is not as important to them as other places in the United States.  School is not something they're like, you need to go to school, or you need to learn so that you can go to  college, because we all know that, like here, it's not really a thing, like sometimes having a college degree  can hurt you. If you want a position or want to be recognized within the community. Yeah, often people ",53:02
1256,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,247,1,Interviewee ,"that get degrees move away that would be able to understand so and they're kind of just over whatever  politics are going on in their village. So yeah, figuring out that barrier of education, and having someone  speak out, that's going to be able to describe it to their people well within their own language as well, so  that they can understand. ",53:02
1259,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,247,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So it's kind of a tension, like you need somebody that's educated but not too educated. So they still, you  know, still part, you know, still can relate, everyone can relate to them. I was going to, I think I understand,  but I wanted to clarify when you say education, you're talking about kind of public education or schooling  not going out there doing trainings. Or would that be included? ",54:20
1257,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,247,1,Interviewee ,"Maybe both. So like with trainings, you can require some of the information but it's, I think it's harder for.  I mean, we have a hard enough time having water plant operators pass their water. What is it like a third  ever at this time, like 30% of the people that take a water plant operator class pass, like even just the  small treated, and it gets worse as you go up along the line, whether it be a level one or level two? So  whatever it is it's going on isn't catching whatever it is the system that they have isn't working. And most  Yeah, I don't have not one water system where a small water certificate is going to do anything besides  just be a paper on the wall, because most systems are level two. And so they're not going to get any credit  from the state basically, for having it and level one. I mean, maybe during the classes [REDACTED], like  level one, maybe one operator, each class passes 10% or less. It's yeah, it takes a lot of studying. And  maybe having that background of like education does help, like knowing how to study, knowing what they  need help in how to study isn't something that I think people gain out here, it's not as important. And  school is just something you do because you have to, not something that you see that's going to be  necessarily beneficial.  ",54:47
1260,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,247,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I have heard that, for some of the people taking the tests, I mean, just knowing how to take a test. Sit  down with a number two pencil for you know, an hour or two is like that's not something folks are always  familiar with. ",56:23
1258,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,247,1,Interviewee ,"And the language barrier. I mean, when you start asking questions like which one is best, or which one is  going to and like with very specific with very specific parts, or very specific wording, I think the wording  can be very difficult at times too. Not everything that's like commonly spoken in our language is going to  be the same of what they grew up with recalling the same object. Or maybe they've never been taught  the right names for a lot of the things that they're having to answer questions on. So I feel like a language  barrier could be something that could be improved, and maybe for some water plant operators having it  in [REDACTED] or whatever it is for our area specifically, might be beneficial, or having somebody teach it  to them in that language might be beneficial.  ",56:38
1264,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,248,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. So I think I kind of know where this is going. But to what degree is the, you know, so sort of chasing  the certification, right?

1261,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,248,1,Interviewee ,"Not much, rather than like, I honestly don't think it really does much, these guys can go and operate their  water plants just fine without having a certificate. Most of what's asked on those questions, I guess, either  are geared towards water systems in the lower 48. We don't have those types of systems they're asking  them questions on. Yeah, I mean, when I have taken exams in the past, just to help guide the class better.  Like I pass it just to like find out what they are asking my water plant operators, what they are going to be  doing for like, sure I can get by because I'm from the lower 48. I know how to take exams, I know how to,  I can decipher like, okay, get rid of two and guess for the last two, if you don't know, that's not something  that they have been taught to do, most likely. And even if you do tell them right before the exam, it's not  something that they're trained to do. And even with the tests themselves, I mean, what are they made in  like [REDACTED] or something like that? Like they're not Alaska specific for water systems that are going  to be relevant. we're severely downscaled from a lot of these water systems without having the same kind  of water quality or, yeah, just the same type of systems.

1265,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 14 ,248,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, it's, uh, you know, it's so easy to sort of take for granted. I mean, if you've never seen a test question  that said, “Which of the following is not true?” You know? I mean, those little tricks that that we, you  know, some of us have been doing for decades. Right? Or, like you said, there's no, you know, if you don't  answer a question, it's wrong. So we answer all the questions, even if you don't know, like these things  that are so ingrained in us.

So  that you they can have the options. Thinking of [REDACTED], thinking of like, people that want to set their  kids up for success living in an area where the standards are very low, you showed up, here's a pat on the  back. That is where the standard is on education, I feel a lot of the times, is you showed up, you kind of  did something, or you turned it in severely late, and you still get credit for doing it is where the education  system is in [REDACTED].

Smoke their fish then go back to where they live in the winter.  [REDACTED] But people started coming here, you know, guys, married [REDACTED] ladies for wives, you  know. So we've got some interesting, family compositions here and they came from both directions. Some  people came to [REDACTED], they had kind of crossed over the Alaska range prospecting again and some  came [REDACTED] because there's a lot of there's a lot of sea traffic that came up. So that was hauled  water and sewer in [REDACTED]. And it has evolved to the system that we have now, the hauled system  that we've got, which is still nowhere near perfect. A lot of people wish they could pay by the gallon for  their water, the argument would get made. Well, water meters don't work in cold weather. Well they  work for a company [REDACTED], right? The water company. My daughter gets water from them. Yeah,  they meter. They meter. So people of course packed water and spilled a honey bucket. After a while the  community realized that, well that's a little too willy nilly. So, the city started a water and sewer haul  system, and on your day, the sewer guy would come in your house. Pick up your honey bucket, tramp his  boots through the living room through the kitchen. Wherever. Spill it in the back of the truck, bring it back  and the water truck would come and they would scoop out, you know, five gallons of water, and fill your  water bucket. And of course we put huge miles on our vehicles. Get the heck beat out of them and then  a few years ago nobody saw this in their bingo card. State weighs and measures came out and oh by the  way your water trucks are like 2000 gallons too big for weight load on pavement. So we had to buy smaller  water trucks. ",00:00
1277,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,33,2,Interviewee ,"So I've lived in Alaska since [REDACTED]. But when I lived there, there wasn't much a sewer lagoon. And  there was a dump. We used honey buckets, packed water from the wellhouse. And, of course chipped ice,  you know. But sanitation was you know, pretty poor. [REDACTED]. And at one point we had a choice. We  could go with a flush haul system that could start getting put together fairly quickly. Or we could wait to  get piped water and sewer. And [REDACTED] very wise elder, he said. ""Yeah, forget that."" He didn't say  that way. He said ""forget that flush haul. We want pipes!"" VSW, and I imagine you guys understand the  difference between Village Safe Water (VSW) and IHS. [REDACTED] and because you know, as all  municipalities, right, has the relationship with VSW. And, you know, back in the old days, [REDACTED]  would call VSW engineers, probably the most trusted state employees, you know, from community's  perspective. Because those guys they had to know everything going on the village and know more about  village politics than the city administrators. You know, to be able to do their job. Be able to come in and  say hey, look, you know, I need you guys to approve this and it was it was really great. They had money,  they were able to travel. [REDACTED] was our engineer for a long time. [REDACTED]. So, we went fly by  night for a while. We used VSW to build what we called sanitation roads because everybody hauled their  honey buckets by Honda. We got some really horrible roads, we gotta fix these roads. So, they said alright,  call them sanitation roads. Tear the beach up, which has been going on for decades. Taking the sand off  of it and you know, fix the roads. They actually built [REDACTED]. So that put a lot of guys to work. And  he came back. And what can we do next? You know, I said, well, you know, we're planning on getting a  honey bucket lagoon. At one time in [REDACTED] there were, oh, man, [REDACTED] ponds right in the  village that people dumped honey buckets in. I'll tell you, on a hot day, [REDACTED] You knew what it was.  And so, I was, well, let's clean these things up, you know. So, we got grant money, hired the guys, got  them all Tyvek suits and some nice aluminum rakes. Fabricated because what happened was when. Two  things have done more damage to the earth than anything else. Two consumer products. Diapers, which  filled landfills. You should have learned that in civil engineering 101. Right? Used to be a landfill was just  a big empty hole on the outside of town where people threw their refrigerators and their plastic and their  paper, grocery bags full of trash. And then along came Pampers. And all of a sudden, the diaper services.  I know all of you, including you, are too young to remember diaper services.  ",00:08

1331,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,41,1,Interviewee ,It was it was. Had to buy smaller water trucks. Sewer trucks pretty much stayed the same.  ,05:32

1332,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,41,1,Interviewee ,"[REDACTED] So um, oh the old trucks, they sold some at auction they may have you know sold them other  places and then we had a crisis for a while because we couldn't get parts for the darn things. We had,  what brand are they. We had parts man spent, you know, four hours of his eight-hour day every day on  eBay and everywhere else looking for parts. So then I said well look at [REDACTED] dump trucks, they're  the same brand man. [REDACTED]. So we have we got we got that then we have we have piped water  service. so here in [REDACTED] we get, as you know, I'm not going to tell you what you already know. We  have [REDACTED] wells, [REDACTED] water treatment plants. We've got the older one up there  [REDACTED], and we got the new one over here at [REDACTED]. We have one lift station out of the airport  that basically just serves [REDACTED], I guess. I think they get their, I think they make their own water.  But I think we move their sewage. And then there's a dumping lift station on the highway. Yeah. Where  the where the sewer trucks go. So when they go out to [REDACTED]. They don't have to go quite so far to  dump sewage. And the sewer. Yeah. You know, a truckload of sewage is pretty heavy. And I gotta say,  these guys that drive these trucks, especially in the wintertime. I mean, they, they're superman. And a ",05:41

Total white out, everything looked like this table. And all of the sudden  my son's like oh no. Off the side on the other side of the road. I'm stuck. I wasn't super badly stuck. But  why don't water and sewer trucks get stuck? Ya know, they were a little higher up, they had a little better  perspective. You know, the state trooper came in to pull us out. It's a tough job driving them things. You  know, it really is. You don't just need a CDL you need you know, some gotta be pretty sharp. Because, you  know, one minute you driving a truck that's empty. the next minute you're driving a truck that's full of  sloshing excrement. And it's just like, I mean, use the principles of, you know, principles of stability in a  ship right to oil tanker. Yeah, you know, center of gravity, all that.

Well, pampers and all of a sudden folded up  wet pampers at least that big. So, multiply that by 2000 a day. Right? What happens to the hole in the  ground? It fills up really fast. And then plastic trash bags. In our case, white plastic garbage can liners that  people would line their honey bucket with. So, you've got a hole in the ground full of water that you're  dumping human waste into. Right? What's supposed to happen? Anaerobic breakdown, right? Yeah, right.  Well now you're dumping plastic bags full of human waste in there. And maybe they'll break open. We  hired guys to go to their and shoot them with BB pellets. But what happens after a few years? The bags  sink to the bottom, they seal it, and all of a sudden you don't have that biological activity going on. So, the ",07:17

They're raking that stuff up. But it had the desired effect. All of the  sudden we were able to close these dumping points, get everybody to go out to the main dump, you  know, and that alone made the community a lot healthier. [REDACTED] So, they went out to the beach  and gathered up truckloads and truckloads of driftwood and laid it down. Then put filter fabric over it,  sometimes under it, and backfilled it. And that worked pretty good, you know? I mean it had its ups and  downs. The roads aren’t that much better now. [REDACTED] But you know we took them out to the dump  and the dump at the time was about the size of this room. It wasn't a very big pit, you know. The village  of back then had [REDACTED] people in it right. Dumping their honey buckets, dumping their trash,  everything. Just a conglomeration of a mess. So, he came back, got on the plane. The next day [REDACTED]  showed up. Said alright, we’re going to figure out how to make this work. So, you guys got to start getting  your reporting straight. So, you know what RUBA is?

Just, I'm really interested, you talked a little bit about, you know, young people  trying to get them interested in doing any of the work. And I'm just wondering if you had any other  thoughts on that of like, Are there initiatives? Or could there be initiatives that might help with that? ",0:42

1337,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,42,1,Interviewee ,"right. Right. Right. So I mean, it's, it's a real team effort to make it happen, make it happen every day. You  know, they're, they're trading off their lists, and they just, you know, but you know, when it's 40 below  and it's blowing, right? You're pumping water, you're dragging the hose, wading through snow, knocking  some ice off of the fill pipe, putting your cam lock on, hooking the hose up to it, right, and then standing  clear for the overflow because you don't want to get wet because it's 40 below. And sometimes these  guys will be pumping sewage, and sometimes not very often, sometimes they'll get sprayed, you know?  And so it can be you know, not not necessarily pretty but some guys stick with it. We've had guys retired  after 20, 25 or more years driving. Some guys last about as long as somebody coming to go to work for  [REDACTED] that gets off the plane sees the price of milk and gets back on the same plane. ",10:25

Yeah.  So these guys are driving sewer truck, right? They're making whatever they make when they start building  the new [REDACTED] they'll be able to go to work for that contractor driving truck for half again as much,  union wages. Yeah, these guys are union too. They do get good benefits. We were talking about this at  the budget meeting last night. I mean, you know how much you know what city employees pay for their ",11:35

And you get to cash out you know [REDACTED] days a year of leave. If you get it accrued  so we do we do have a very good benefits package. Yeah, and it's steady work, you know. As opposed to  working in construction. But we've had a lot of construction. In fact they're gonna do that they're building  [REDACTED] up here. They're gonna tear down the old [REDACTED]. so there's steady work for drivers.  There always is we have we have several contracts with three to two and a half you know contractors in  town that are always hauling sand dirt all summer long. So if you get competitive to get people's drive  from the city Yeah, you know I mean, I'd rather I'd rather be droning driving a dump truck right than  hauling hose because it ain't snowing. Then you’re fighting mosquitoes yeah, yeah, stepping in dog waste  and you name it you name it. You know I mean everything so so we you know I don't know when we  started building pipe water and sewer I sort of do it was around the turn of the century. Now remember  I said yesterday if you're going to build and I hope you'll learn this in civil engineering 101 if you're gonna,  If something is worth building it's worth building right? Yeah. Bless their hearts and they're a contractor  for this project [REDACTED] designed the water and sewer system and they you know they did a  [REDACTED] job. I don't think they did any geo studies because we've got lift stations, every house has a  grinder pump outside. And of course, they get plugged up and it doesn't take much to plug a grinder pump  up apparently. But the grinder pumps and the lift stations slash the connection box. They'll sink into the  ground. Yeah. And they're breaking, people have gone months without water. And what happens is the  city says well it's your responsibility. And they say wait, I bought this house three years ago. Nobody told  me that there's got to be my responsibility. So there's been conflict with that. People had to fix their own,  you know, run that run or run a hose from the connection point into their house and call the city say come  turn the water onto the hose. ",11:35

1281,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,34,1,Interviewee ,"Well, they ruined they ruined the local. They're local government specialists. See the other people that  were cool worked for the state, and your VSW engineers. Then you had your local government specialists  who work for DCRA. And their job was to work with local governments. [REDACTED]. They had a budget,  they'd come out, we'd show them around [REDACTED] every few weeks. you know, how is everything  going. [REDACTED] They've got, see they've got measures they've got to meet, right? So many of your  villages are hitting the score. If they're not, why not? Why aren't you doing your job? Well, because I've  got a stack of stuff this big, I gotta go through every quarter of the reports from all my villages. And you  don't have time to say hey, how's it going? Ya know, what's new and exciting? It's like, you didn't turn in  your financial report to the city council. Ya know, so there's been a lot of trust and respect lost by  communities with DCRA because of that which is really sad. Because the Constitution requires that there  be a department to assist municipalities, local governments. Of course, it also says the mission of the  Department of Corrections is rehabilitation. So, we started to get construction money. Now one of the  one of the things that in [REDACTED] we like doing is forced account So force account is where the village  gets [REDACTED] to do this. And then state goes out to bid and finds an engineer management firm to  design it, and then send the pusher out. And of course, get all the equipment. But it'd be like one guy, the  mechanic. One guy is the foreman. And everybody else is local on the job. [REDACTED] It came out very  nice. And these guys, these superintendents, they are you know, they're what you would call in England  a builder. Okay, this is the guy who comes in before the grounds even clear and tells the dozer operator  what to do. And then he lays out where the pilings or the footings are gonna be and supervises and hands  on every single step of the way. I mean, they know electric, they know plumbing, they know structural,  they know wells and everything. [REDACTED] And when I say a long time, I mean a long time ago. So, I  don't know if he's still around or not. But these guys, you know, they know how to get along with, with  the local crew. They know how to pick talent and how to fire people. Just really, they're squirrely. Oh man  they can be squirrely, but we would not have half the infrastructure out here that we do without guys like  that. So, the next thing that happened was we started building the lagoon. And one fell apart. And it was ",12:21
1283,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,35,1,Interviewee ,"it was two cells, a dump cell and the sewage cell. And it was designed capacity wise to handle not just  honey buckets, but eventually outfall from a community wide collection system. So, we got that done.  [REDACTED].  ",12:21

They were they were, I think he was building something to treat gray water. [REDACTED]. Well, you know,  and, you know, here's the thing. [REDACTED] But you know, [REDACTED] had a contest a few years ago  and that was part of why he built that plant over here to you know, find a black box solution. Right. And,  and there isn't one there is no one size fits all. In places where you've got high energy costs and  permafrost. Those are the two banes of existence, right? Down in the lower 48 Fine here's your copy of ",15:51
1347,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,44,1,Interviewee ,"the plumbing code. build it. Up here, it's like here's your copy of the plumbing code well it says that you  know there's got to be this far. can't do it. So there's not going to be a black box there are plenty of  potential test beds for various black boxes. Schools right you can have in schools are up in the air you can  have one bathroom so that's gonna be the black box test bathroom. Right? And gather your data from  that or whatever you got hanging on the bottom of the building. But they had that contest but I don't  think anybody won anything. But you know when you when you when you start to think about technology,  what am I seeing? [REDACTED]  But the old [REDACTED] post office was right on [REDACTED]. And so then you got composting toilets,  which had been tried composting toilets are okay, if you are a power user. Yeah. I mean, you got to pay  attention to what you're doing. You got to keep throwing in the wood chips. The grass cuttings, right. I  mean, you got to Yeah, they are. Yeah, they are they're high maintenance and when they quit working,  it's like get this thing out of my house. Oh, yeah. Up in [REDACTED] they had a couple. [REDACTED] set  one up there. [REDACTED] She's like you guys should try it. I think somebody may have but they're, you  know, they're for like, a single individual. Not good for a family. The toilets, like in [REDACTED], for  example, I guess in [REDACTED] too. They run on a vacuum system. They don't run, they're not hydraulic,  they run in a vacuum. So you push the button. And so in a lot of these when they retrofitted that's  something also is if you get a house is 40 years old or more? Right? How do you put a bathroom in it?  Yeah, how do you put a kitchen sink in it? Some houses, the [REDACTED] houses, they're called  [REDACTED] houses because that was the name of the program. [REDACTED] it had a plumbing wall. There  was a kitchen sink out front. And there was the bathroom and there's just a couple of fittings, they there  was a plumbing wall, but it didn't connect to anything. So when you build water and sewer in the village,  right, then you've got a most important tool in your toolbox as a Sawzall because you're cutting and  putting stuff in and sometimes you put an extent. we talked for a while about just having a bolt on  bathroom. And in fact, somewhere north they're using a bolt on bathroom. Somewhere up north you  know who to talk to is [REDACTED]. Yeah, yeah. And ask them who it is. What village up north are getting  prefab bathrooms and kitchens because they're getting running water? Yeah, yeah. Okay. And that, you  know, that's one solution. It saves the grief of traveling back and forth the house and cutting and pasting  walls and all that. If you can just bolt it on and cut a door in for them. Right? Yeah, then they're good. So  somebody was doing that I forget where they would know [REDACTED]. And it was super insulated, you  know, and I described super insulating. We don't use super insulating. everybody uses board, you know,  Styrofoam walls. but you know, I described super insulating to people as building a down coat for your  house. Right? So here's a wall here's a wall instead of having solid studs, connecting them to being a  conductor. Have a stud here, stud here, stud here. And then you just weave the insulation in and out.  That's how you super insulate. But she designed some houses and she may have done it for Canada, but  they're, you know they had solar component which was a you know big window South facing window with  you know 55-gallon drums for water and they would just paint it black to you know to absorb heat. But it  was it was designed she said that you know if you build a house like this you could heat it on 55 gallons of  fuel a year. [REDACTED]. he came over here I said [REDACTED] come over, see my fast internet man. And  you know five minutes before he came in I did a speed test. And I have like 56 megs. Yeah, he comes over  yeah, I want to update my computer. He's technology kind of guy. Fact, while you're here, grab a few of  the newspapers right here. [REDACTED] But you can build real tight. You can build real tight that's possible.  And of course, every dollar you offset in the heating cost is $1 you can spend on other utilities, other  utilities. So, you know, again, the bane of existence from a civil engineering standpoint, right? Is energy ",15:51
1348,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,45,1,Interviewee ,"cost and permafrost, right? Oh, yeah. Let's dig into lagoon let's go down 20 feet from ground level. You  know, and they're building Alaska Highway. Talk about permafrost, man they cut and see the problem is  once you pop the cover off of permafrost it's like you've shaken up a bottle of pop and then done it. Yeah,  it will not freeze again. So there were a lot of false starts on the Alaska Highway they would start cutting  and they would just end up in in cat sinking mud there we better try different route. Out here. They used  to have reindeer. And you can still I think see in some places from the air where the reindeer just tore the  ground up. Torn up down to the permafrost. And, you know you got buildings that are on pilings. My  house heaves. I'm on pilings, you know, permafrost can be bad business. Next time you go to [REDACTED]  go to the permafrost tunnel. You've heard of that? The Army Corps of Engineers has a permafrost research  facility, it's a tunnel. There's really like you go and you see, you know, vegetation and you see, you know,  animal remains. It is cool. It is cool. And if you're gonna be thinking about infrastructure of any sort in the  north, you gotta think about permafrost. Especially since it's no longer the solid foundation it used to be.  There's an anecdotal story that they were building a clinic up in [REDACTED] and they were driving piling  and it just kept going and going and going and going and going, they kept welding more pieces on going  and going and finally somebody said what’s that? Well the piling it hit the ice went like that, and came  back up. [REDACTED] You know who else to talk to if you haven't, on infrastructure on building conditions  is [REDACTED]. But you know, go ask her she's got all the time to talk to you about just what challenges  [REDACTED] has had in, in construction out here. And what challenges they have getting the water, right?  What are your challenges in villages where you still don't have good water and sewer into the clinic.  They've been fortunate even in places like [REDACTED] that’s got a very limited system. The clinic is  hooked up to water and sewer. [REDACTED]. ",15:51

[REDACTED] comes out in the small water plant, builds this system where he had like five- gallon jugs of water from the different wells, and came out with water like this. So, we're trying to figure  out how we get people to pay. We said, look, you got to start paying a water fee. Yes, we know you go  and pack your own water. However, we need to show confidence to VSW that when the time comes, you  guys will pay water bills when we have pipes going to your house. So, we had a bingo and a pull tabs  operation going in the city office. [REDACTED] went and got two milk jugs and put just regular straight up  well water in one of them. And the nice clear water chemistry water in the other one. And people would  come in and say hey, if you pay your water bill, you drink some of this water here, you'll see what you'll  be getting when you get pipes. And it worked. People were like holy cow. Yes. And so yeah, gotta use a  little psychology. So, then it came time to start building the new water plant, [REDACTED]. And they  started laying pipe all over town because my concern was always that we get pipe water and sewer in  [REDACTED]. And it does. But people got running water. I moved to [REDACTED] and people would say to  me, do you miss [REDACTED]? I'd say yeah, every morning when I'm taking a shower.

If you get a chance, talk to [REDACTED] might be your best bet then yeah. Say tell us  about cellulitis, i.e., boils. Okay because back in the old era, big social event of the evening in a lot of  villages, right? It's taking steam. And if you don't keep your steam house clean, [REDACTED] You get boils  and so [REDACTED] at one point had a pretty aggressive campaign. I guess they must have bought stock  in Clorox or something they were saying keep your steam house clean. We're tired of people come here  with boils [REDACTED].

I'll tell you well, you know  what, I haven't seen a kid with impetigo in three years. And, and ever seen a kid with impetigo? It's, it's  not particularly pretty, it's sores that will grow, you know around their mouth, you know, inside their nose,  and it's, you know, it's treatable. You gotta scrub the [REDACTED] out of it. You get a two-year-old kids  crawling around in the floor, comes down with impetigo. They are not happy when mom says, you know, ",23:49
1288,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,36,1,Interviewee ,"let's clean it off. They'll tell you that they'll say yeah, and these villages that got running water, then it's  just been an enormous change in the in the health benefits. Yeah, a lot. A lot. A lot of things changed  course. 2020 is probably the healthiest year we ever had out here. See [REDACTED], I said [REDACTED],  why [REDACTED] going broke? There was a while they were laying people off middle of the pandemic.  And [REDACTED] is laying people off. And I heard statistically, yeah, clinic visits were down 40% I said,  [REDACTED], what was going on here? She goes everybody's wearing masks, everybody's staying home.  But you know, running water was absolutely a public health class. Yeah, it absolutely was. Yeah, know,  when you go to wash your hands, you go to the bathroom in a honey bucket. [REDACTED], then you go to  the wash basin in the bathroom. That in some cases was just as brown as what was in the honey bucket.  Because people wash their hands in it all day long. And nobody used rubber gloves. [REDACTED]. But just  like I said if you get the chance you know talk to talk to [REDACTED] just number one ask about you know  skin disease little kids’ impetigo. General health benefits and they'll tell you they'll be happy to tell you  about that. So, we got that water plant now we got the big one started. And I moved to [REDACTED] that  I came back in [REDACTED] to go to work for [REDACTED] and I've been here ever since. [REDACTED] son  grew up hauling honey buckets to the dump on the [REDACTED] you know. And we've got villages where  it's still pretty bad [REDACTED]. I mean they're using bunkers. Bunkers are black bins.  ",23:49
1289,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,36,1,Interviewee ,"[REDACTED] Okay. So, I got a hold of the sanitation guys and bring a bunker over here, pulled up, started  cracking over the bottles in the middle of sanitation [REDACTED] and then they let them go, they said go  sue us. You know, I mean, if you want to go to court fine, they're gonna say no evidence. They use these  black buckets up there and they've actually got a new lagoon that was built a few years ago. Another one,  a VSW engineer to talk to is [REDACTED].  ",29:16
1292,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,36,1,Interviewer 1 ,"It got built in stages though, right?  ",31:12
1290,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,36,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  ",31:15
1293,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,36,1,Interviewer 1 ,And then there was a fire. Did that affect the pipes at all?  ,31:16
1291,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,36,1,Interviewee ,"Oh no, when the school burned down actually, they hadn't. I don't think they started laying pipe by then.  They may have but it wasn't it was new there. They had to run mainline out from the big buildings. Then  they went over to [REDACTED]. They're finally talking about getting water up into the old part of town.  Which is a hodgepodge. Look at the survey and you know; the lines are like that. ",31:19
1351,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,45,1,Interviewer 3 ,"I mean, you answered a lot of them. Talking about [REDACTED]. I was actually just looking through. And I  think you've touched on all of them. ",31:31
1350,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,45,1,Interviewer 2 ,What's your opinion on certification? And like how certified operators? ,31:44
1349,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,45,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, I think it's essential. I think it's essential. You know, I mean, they are they're handling the stuff that  we put in our bodies. Yeah, it's not. It's not like, wash your lettuce before you make a salad. It's like, turn  on the faucet and drink. Yeah. You know, certifications, absolutely essential. I have to say that the water  operators here and around the state do a great job because you never, you know, boil water notice. Yeah,  because somebody may be rinsed out their honey bucket, or the kids were playing with water and there  was dog waste in front of the hose and splash back up. When they do E coli tests. They draw the water  out of the, you know, out of the public pipe. They don't draw it out of the well. They don't draw it before  it gets there. They draw it out of the public pipe. So it's not like the water has got E Coli in it. Something  got on the hose. Yeah. So no, they do a very good job. They've got they're very well supported. If you talk  to [REDACTED]. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so these guys, they you never think about the water  operators. They're usually decent paying job in the village, you know, and they're very diligent, you know,  they're very diligent. They don't get a whole lot of hours necessarily. Yeah, you know, but they're over  there. They backwash. And when they got to backwash, they're doing what needs to get done. Sometimes ",31:48
1352,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,46,1,Interviewee ,"they've got a washateria they gotta maintain too, and, you know, a water plant there. Have you guys  gotten out to any villages? ",31:48
1294,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,36,1,Interviewer 1 ,I remember after the fire it seemed a lot easier to get around town to me.  ,31:49
1295,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,37,1,Interviewee ,"It was smoother. So, I look at the look at the map right. [REDACTED] So yeah, so the pipes, the pipes were  built in stages. I think they're still working on them. You know, they have problems they have, you know,  they have freeze ups they are people who haven't been able to pay their water bills and they've gotten  disconnected. You know, it's it is not without its problems. And there are some people one of the things  that is done and you can talk to you know, people from [REDACTED] or other villages. The bad public  health impact is it's made the kids and the young man lazy. Because you're not telling your 10-year-old  son go pack water. It's Saturday we got to do laundry, go get water to fill the washing machine and they  grabbed the sled and they grabbed the five-gallon buckets go get it or go get ice they still do go get ice  but you know there's no work involved in turning on the faucet. And that was a traditional chore, you  know, going out to pack water. Yeah or pack ice and you know they don't do that anymore so it's had an  effect on. It's putting more free time on some of these guys. ",31:52
1357,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,46,1,Interviewer 2 ,Not yet. COVID kind of changed some of our plans. ,33:23
1353,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,46,1,Interviewee ,So even if you can get come back here when it's river season.  ,33:27
1354,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,46,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Get [REDACTED] or somebody take you out by boat. Go down to [REDACTED] and see a village water  plant. Yeah. And I mean, they're not overly complex, but they're, you know, kind of complex you know,  and stuff gets old, you know, a lot of corrosion sometimes and you gotta replace things and you know,  these operators they're always up to the task.  ",33:32
1358,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,46,1,Interviewer 2 ,We'll be back in [REDACTED]. ,33:32
1359,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,46,1,Interviewer 2 ,"and you feel like the certification I mean from your like, from watching it happen the certification prepares  them well to manage the systems they need to? ",34:05
1355,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,46,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, operationally Yes, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yep. Yep. And [REDACTED] does a real  good job on that. [REDACTED] trains water operators. Yeah, they do a good job on that. Yep. ",34:14
1360,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,46,1,Interviewer 3 ,So another question we've been asking is kind of is there any water infrastructure challenge you think  would be the most important to fix so if you had a magic wand? ,34:29
1356,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,46,1,Interviewee ,"Cost of chemicals. Cost of chemicals, right. Potassium permanganate is hazmat, right? So yeah, cost of  chemicals is a big one. And then yeah, if you run out of potassium permanganate in the middle of February  right, then blowing like crazy. You know you might have to shut her down. So, you know, there's supply  chain for supply chain for consumables. Yeah. But chemicals is a is a is an important one. And then getting,  you know getting the next generation, you know, when you go around, you may notice that a lot of the  water plant operators you meet have been doing it for a while. Yeah. Yeah, I won't say where they started,  but they've been doing it for a while. And so, you know, young people need to see that, hey, if you're good  with your hands, you can do math, decent High School. And you're not afraid to show up for work every  day. There's a job that's going to need filling. Yeah, you know. And the other thing is, is gotta, like I said,  Talk to [REDACTED]. You know, that whole that whole process, I think needs to be reformed a little bit,  especially in light of this. This could be a question that's worth asking is, with the infrastructure money  that's coming, water and sewer infrastructure money, if the state gets to control any of it, are they still  gonna hold the RUBA score against a village to get this federal money that's coming anyway. That's not ",34:39
1361,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,47,1,Interviewee ,"competitive EPA money. It's not Clean Water Act money. It's, you know, COVID money. Are they still gonna  bust their chops on that? Yeah. Now, [REDACTED]. Have you talked to her? You could. Yeah you guys are  on the East Coast, right?  ",34:39
1302,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,37,1,Interviewer 2 ,Was it usually men who packed water? Packed ice? ,35:10
1296,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,37,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah ice mostly. Yeah dad, son, uncle. I've seen plenty of women packing water. Five gallon of water  weighs a lot. ",35:14
1303,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,37,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Do you think it like gave men, like did it have a gendered impact? ",35:25
1297,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,37,1,Interviewee ,I wouldn't go there it was it was like a traditional chore and whoever was around especially if you're going  by sled right there's snow and tell the kids go pack water boys or girls water the impact on you know a  little more free-time is more likely on men. You know adolescent boys you know? Because they don't have  to pack water anymore. Unless of course you're disconnected.  ,35:30
1300,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,37,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Do people generally seem, are people happy to have piped water? ",36:05
1298,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,37,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, yeah, you know, I know my brother-in-law was really happy to get it in our old house. ",36:10
1301,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,37,1,Interviewer 1 ,Is there anyone that prefers like traditional water sources? Or is it just people that get disconnected and  don't have a choice? ,36:16
1299,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,37,1,Interviewee ,"I would say that there probably still are a lot of people who get ice because it's the tastiest water there is.  You know people who catch rainwater. Yeah, you don't have to catch rainwater and you know use it for  keep washing machine full fill the water bucket of the house from the from the rain barrel you know it's  starting to rain like heck. [REDACTED] would be like go get the rainwater. There's people in [REDACTED]  who collect rainwater. It makes very good very good tea and coffee because when you're adding ",36:24
1304,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,38,1,Interviewee ,"ingredients to the water and by law in Alaska waters got to be chlorinated might be fluoridated. Yeah, and  the water is coming from 300 feet down. It's pristine. Except when you can float a quarter. Throw your  compass off but yeah, there's still people who pack ice. Yeah. It's just there's not as much. Maybe need to  because you fill a big trash can full of ice. So that would be you know, the house water. You might you  might pack you know, five gallon or two for hand wash water. Yeah. But that bucket of ice was your  drinking water. And there's still there's still elders that are like, yeah. But, you know, ice season is getting  shorter and shorter. Right. I mean, the lagoon. Yeah, with December, it rained all of December  [REDACTED]. ",36:24
1362,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,47,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, basically, as far as I'm concerned, yeah. Oh, you two are the [REDACTED]? Yeah. So where are you  guys from originally? ",37:06
1365,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,47,1,Interviewer 2 ,Basically ,37:06

1363,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,47,1,Interviewee ,"Well, I mean, you know, you kind of you kind of pick it up, you know, you kind of pick it up, that's one of  the one of the advantages of having spent most of my career in the [REDACTED]. Yeah, you learn all the  stuff. I mean, you know, being a [REDACTED], you gotta understand all that. So, if you get the opportunity,  talk to her or see if you could get one of her aides that deals with because she has been bragging, she said  the infrastructure bill, we now have enough money to close out the SDS sanitation deficiency, because we  have enough money to do that $1.2 billion or something. So, I would, you know, I would definitely try to  make contact with her office, you could do it in [REDACTED] and tell them you know, who you are and  what you're doing. You've been up in [REDACTED] and talking to people and somebody said you should  talk to [REDACTED], because she brought a bunch of the sanitation money in and then you know the  questions are, right, ""how long is it gonna take to spend it?"" Right? There's only so many companies in the  state that do that kind of work, right. You know, you're not gonna fly some mechanical engineer up from  the lower 48, who's never been to Alaska before give them a reciprocal license and say, go build a water  system. So there's that. Yeah. But I would say, you know, you know, gotta give a little bit of credit to  [REDACTED] for what she's been able to do. And I think they can, you know, they can give you at least you  know, from the policy side, see, see how they're thinking, see how they're thinking. And I'm sure you  know, by then you'd be able to formulate some questions.  ",37:49
1306,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,38,1,Interviewer 1 ,[REDACTED] ,38:19
1305,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,38,1,Interviewee ,"It is it is. Yes, that's correct. But they've had the population issue for a few years now. And it's been the  big problem is there's some there's some aggressive parasites that are getting into the herd. But yes, they  also [REDACTED]. So yeah, so yeah, you get you get ice on, you get an animal that lives on lichens, it'll paw  through the snow to get down to the lichens, but they start hitting ice and they're not able to get ice open.  So that's the problem that caribou are having. And like I say, up there, muskox up there, in the [REDACTED]  area, all that rain came down on just literally rotting some of the flesh on their hump. So yeah, he had a  real good, real good photo presentation about climate change, and climate change is impacting water and  sewer infrastructure in [REDACTED]. Right. The ostensible cause everybody's saying is, well, because it  rained so hard that the lagoon filled up with too much water, put too much pressure on it, and about a  [REDACTED] section collapsed. [REDACTED] A river that goes up in there, always go needle fishing there,  black fish fishing. So, it's got all that effluent there. So, I'm like, Well, you know what, if they're going to  rebuild it, they'd better put some thermosiphons in. Yeah, because who knows, maybe you got a weakness  in the permafrost underneath, they haven't done any kind of engineering work to look at that. Like that  it's kind of irritating. And then they're gonna build a new lagoon, well, you know, you better do some good  geotechnical work here. Don't just, you know, don't just take a hose and we're good, you know, some  things that they call money funds. You know, let's, let's spend. They do drill I mean, they do. Find out  where that permafrost is, you know, if you got to put a thermosiphon in, put a thermosiphon in. You guys  know what thermosiphons are, right? They got them on the [REDACTED]. We used to call them VSMs on  the pipeline, vertical support members. So, you know, it's going to increase the cost to do it right. But  here's the thing. Here's the thing, to do it, right. You're gonna have to spend more money on engineering  and design. You're just gonna have to, you're gonna have to do more detailed geotechnical work. It's not  just, you know, dig down and have the foreman say, okay, yeah, that's good. You know, I mean, you gotta  you gotta you gotta start getting some stamped reports. And you've got to get a really good outline of, of  where the permafrost is, and you've got to start getting better material that that lagoon in [REDACTED]  was made of pure beach sand. Nothing mixed into it. We got road gravel one time from [REDACTED]. One  barge load of tailings million bucks. Delivered. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So and I'll tell you this, there's there's  another angle, especially in places like [REDACTED]. The beach. They started pulling you know, the state  doesn't say nothing because [REDACTED] so yeah, that's the cost of that's the ecological cost. Ya know.  And the cultural cost of getting water and sewer because they used to live in the dunes. Let me show ya.  ",38:32
1366,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,47,1,Interviewer 2 ,Do you think she's really tuned into the needs of rural Alaska? ,39:45
1364,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,47,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, yeah. You know, she's, she's on the [REDACTED] Committee. Yeah. She's been the chairman of the  [REDACTED] Committee. She's on the [REDACTED] committee, has been, they change so much.  [REDACTED] is on the [REDACTED] Committee but this doesn't have much to do with commerce, except  with the Denali commission. And I'm not sure what the Denali commission have they got water and sewer.  It's denali.gov. And you can look at their workplans and see if they've got sanitation money in there. So if  you've got you got anything else that has come to mind? ",39:48
1370,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,48,1,Interviewer 2 ,Is there anything else we should have asked you about? ,40:40
1368,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,48,1,Interviewee ,"There could be. We have some, you know, we have some intrinsic weaknesses in education in rural Alaska.  Motivated kids, you know, they go to [REDACTED] or they go to, well, actually, you know, they go to  [REDACTED], which is more of a Voc Ed type place. And I don't know, if they teach water and sewer out  there. You know, they could teach water and sewer operator, and kids could come home from  [REDACTED] with a water and, you know, with a level one license water treatment, not necessarily  distribution, not sewage collection, because there's, you know, there's a tier of licenses, and if all your I  don't know if anybody in [REDACTED] even needs a collection license, but they've got, you know, level  one treatment. So, you know, they could get, they could get, you know, a real basic license and come  back, you know, then they have to stay on top of it to keep it. So, there's, there's, there's that way. Now,  pardon me. But, you know, there's got to be, you know, in the schools, when we talk about career- oriented education. They should be, I mean kids don't go on field trips, here in [REDACTED]. Kids don't go  on field trips, where can you go on a field trip in [REDACTED]? let's see [REDACTED], there are a number  of places in [REDACTED] that kids can go and [REDACTED]. There's places the kids could go on field trips,  they don't go on and they go to the fire station on fire prevention week. So, you know, exposure, exposure  to what these jobs are. And what you'll find is, you'll see this with health aides. You'll see this some cases  with the with the intrinsic leadership in the community. You know, council members, city council or tribal  council members, administrators, a lot of it is one or two families have, you know, fed the health aid  system, right, my mom was a health aide and her mom was a midwife. Yeah, and now I'm a health aide.  Or my dad ran the power plant. Some cases my mom ran the power plant. Now I do. And the same thing  kind of goes with water plants, too. So. But that's good, because people that go into it are motivated.  They've seen what it's like, you know, and it's no surprise to them. But, you know, one of the big problems  that we have in the villages is sometimes a brain drain. And I'll talk about gender. Who used the G word  yesterday?  ",41:02
1369,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,48,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. So one of the one of the things that has been observed historically out in the villages is who gets  most of the jobs, women, yeah, right. Maybe because they went to college for a year or two or three or  four. Guys are less inclined to, especially when they're 18, 19 years old, they're less inclined to leave the  village right? Because, Oh, good. I'm not in high school anymore. I can go do whatever I want. You know,  do stuff outside. Take care of my parents take care my grandparents. Meanwhile, the young ladies are  like, I'm a big big girl in a big big world. And they go to [REDACTED]. It's an old song. And you know, they  go to college. Maybe they finish it, they say I'm gonna be a teacher. Right? They go to college, maybe they  don't go the whole time they come back, they become a teacher aid and they take more classes. There's ",44:08

1373,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,49,1,Interviewee ,"some people if you asked how long it took them to get their teaching degree like 20 years, because they're  doing it by distance ed, doing it on teleconferencing, not even on the internet. teleconferencing, right?  That will change once we get broadband out in the villages. So, there are there are strategies, I think that  are out there to both encourage young people to enter you know, I mean water running a water plant.  That's a technical career. Yeah, that's a technical career. And it's one that you'd be very proud of and it's  one that directly affects the lives of everybody in your community every day in a positive fashion. And you  know, once you can communicate that to somebody who says yeah, I'd really like to stay here in the village  and be able to make enough gas you know, go bird hunting in the spring and moose hunting. I support my  family, I'm not stereotyping the demand of subsistence. But you know, actually, I want to make enough  money to pay my internet bill. So these opportunities can be there. The problem is right, how much can  they get paid for it? And so that would be an interesting little bit of side action is call [REDACTED] villages.  Say How much do you pay your water plant operator? what do you pay them an hour? how many hours  do they get a day? you know, and then when you come up with that average boy that's gonna be a  powerful number. It's gonna be like 18.75 an hour for three hours a day you know? Yeah, and these guys  as was shown in [REDACTED] when a water plant operator did not turn off the fluoride pump like he was  told to do, you got people's lives in your hands. So I guess that's my answer to that question. Oh, you  know, actually found a stack of these things here. A little faded in the sun. This is my cell phone number  right here.  ",44:08

1327,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,40,1,Interviewer 1 ,What's the biggest challenges in [REDACTED]? ,54:39
1323,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,40,1,Interviewee ,"Costs. cost, cost, cost ",54:41
1328,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,40,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Cost, like you talking about cost of operations or capital? ",54:44
1324,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,40,1,Interviewee ,Capital costs. They just got bids on the [REDACTED] project. ,54:48
1329,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,40,1,Interviewer 2 ,[REDACTED] million.  ,54:56
1325,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 2 ,40,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah way more than expected and that's gonna continue to go up because, you know, we've got all the  right of way laid out. But the cost of Arctic pipe must be going through the roof. Must be you know. So,  you know specialized materials there's not a real national market for. Oh and of course it's a seasonal  market and it's a government driven market right you get very few private contractors that are like oh  yeah, I need 64,000 feet of Arctic pipe. You know, engineering of course you take. The engineering is about  done so you can take 10% or 50% off of that [REDACTED]. And some of it is I'm not gonna say it's, it's, you  know, it's necessarily gouging. But there's a what we're going to run into is with all this infrastructure  money that's coming people are going to go for the big projects and when it comes time to run 6000 linear  feet of Arctic pipe in [REDACTED], ""I can be building school somewhere else, you know, with my crew"", so  there's gonna be there's gonna be so I think there's going to be some pretty serious competition in the  marketplace. Project against project you know, people are used to some free here [REDACTED]. That was  that was an expensive project. Like where's the next [REDACTED] project? [REDACTED]. And they got cold  feet. They were gonna put it up here right at the corner. Right at the [REDACTED] corner. It would end up  behind [REDACTED]. Well you know what I saw yesterday I'm driving down the road I hear sirens right. I  see blue lights, I pull over. [REDACTED] ",54:57
1379,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, so that's kind of that's kind of the deal. So let's start with you. Tell us about you. What's your job?  How long you've been doing it? Where are you from? ",00:33
1374,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewee ,"[REDACTED]. As [REDACTED] mentioned, we finalized the roads and infrastructure last year, and we  started putting four houses up there, they're almost done. And we plan on putting six more houses this  year, and depending on funding, you know, hopefully we move forward with six a year. But four is typical  if we don't have any extra funding. ",00:44
1380,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewer 1 ,Who's building the houses? ,01:59
1375,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewee ,"We do force account. You know, we do it ourselves. ",02:01
1381,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewer 1 ,"But like, I mean, you guys are swinging hammers, or? ",02:06
1376,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewee ,"[REDACTED], yeah we hire our own crews, mostly our own tribal members, you know, to build the houses.  So most of it's in house. We contract out mechanical and electrical. Yeah. Okay. ",02:09
1382,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewer 1 ,I didn't know that. That's cool. So is the road open? Like could we? ,02:23
1377,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewee ,Roads open. You're free to go up there and drive around.  ,02:32
1383,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewer 1 ,I haven't driven through there yet.  ,02:34
1378,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewee ,"So yeah, it's not being maintained by the city yet. But it's, it's still in great shape. You know, it was  constructed well, and yeah, we're really excited. I mean, traditionally, we build in scattered sites all around  town. So this is the first time we've actually got a chance to stay in one area and work and we're really  excited about not building on other people's property. And you know, being centralized, streamlining  everything. ",02:37
1384,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,50,2,Interviewer 1 ,"That was I was hoping to talk with [REDACTED], too, because I remember, I've been hearing from her for  20 years that [REDACTED] is a landless tribe and can't build housing for our people. And like, so I know  this a long time coming on that. ",03:14
1385,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,51,1,Interviewee ,"Sure. And she's right. Like, one of the things I'd like to do in the future is to partner with local corporations,  like [REDACTED], because they have all the land, you know, rather than [REDACTED] buying a million dollar  property, and you know, hopefully there can be a partnership there where we can serve our communities  better. ",03:28
1389,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,51,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So talking about planning the subdivision, this is probably big process with all the roads and the drainage  and everything else. But what would you talk about with water? I mean, I'm assuming it's going to be  trucked water. ",03:50
1386,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,51,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. So, you know, we had to fill out an application to build a subdivision. And at that time, we had no  really clue about the feasibility of piped water and sewer, the costs and all that stuff. And we knew it was  going to be huge. So we planned on doing pipe water, you know, until pieces fall in place for I mean, I'm  sorry, we plan on doing hauled water until the pieces fall in place for the pipe water. But the goal was  always to get to pipe. You know, but in an effort to get people housed. You know, we went with hauled  for now. ",04:05
1390,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,51,1,Interviewer 1 ,"The houses that you're building, how did was there? I mean, you had to decide on tank size. I mean, did  you have to think about driveways, what did you have to think about how trucks are going to backup or? ",04:42
1387,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,51,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah well you know, well, [REDACTED] has a municipal code that determines you know, how much water  you have to have at a minimum depending on house size and you know when you when you fill in a site  permit application you have to make sure you have to identify the driveway you know how they're going  to access it stuff like that so yeah I know they require a 20 foot path to deliver the pipe water sewer so it  does dictate you know how we set the house on the pad or you know the design of how everything lays  out ",04:53
1391,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,51,1,Interviewer 1 ,but it sounds like the preferred goal would be to have piped water ,05:37
1388,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,51,1,Interviewee ,"Definitely. We know there's a lot of beneficial impacts of having pipe water compared to hauled. There's  even a few people that don't have hauled, you know they're washing out of buckets or you know,  whatever methods they could even though that's not allowed by the city no more it's still happening. You  know, so there's benefits all around you know, for pipe water including savings to the city, you know, and,  you know, sanitary reasons and you know, COVID You know, there's all kinds of things that the pipe water  is beneficial for. ",05:42
1395,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,52,1,Interviewer 1 ,"that's been one of the things we've been trying to understand from people is you know, is some people  that we've talked to prefer not to have piped water but it seems like everyone who builds systems wants  pipe wants the pipes. Yeah. ",06:26
1392,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,52,1,Interviewee ,I'm curious to know the reasons for that. ,06:48
1396,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,52,1,Interviewer 1 ,"We were too. Yeah, so some people don't like the physical pipes. They think it's ugly. Some people prefer  traditional water sources, right. They don't like the taste of piped water. So it's been you know, some  people like to haul ice because that's what they've done. So we've you know, out at the airport, we're  talking to folks that are from all over the region. So you know, it seems like when we talk to like the city  they'd love to pipe everything if they could, but then when we talk to individuals not everyone is it doesn't  seem like they're always as passionate about, pipes or nothing you know, are you on piped water?  Depends how much you use yeah, I've done it both ways when I was single and it was just me it was  actually cheaper to be on hauled water because I used so little water, you know. But now you know having  kids and a spouse you know a real house and doing laundry like an adult and all that I wouldn't want to  go back. I'm pretty happy with piped water. So looking at challenges you mentioned so what why. Why  with the subdivision, are you not able to do piped water? Is it just a money thing? Or ",06:50
1393,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,52,1,Interviewee ,"No, I live on the road over here in [REDACTED] so you know as you know the pipe waters kind of that way  towards the middle of the town spreading out so it's not here yet. I actually I got a family of [REDACTED]  in my house and we go through 1000 gallons a week easily. So and that's really expensive for me so that's  like $550 bill every month so I would love to see pipe water I think it's probably if I remember right it's like  three times cheaper for me at least I think. To pay for piped rather than for the hauled service. Money is  the biggest thing obviously. We did a feasibility study which I'll hand to you guys. You guys can probably  finger through it. I printed these out, I jumbled them a little bit but I think I only have three I was trying to  print a fourth when you guys called I figured I wouldn't let you wait ",07:27
1397,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,52,1,Interviewer 2 ,That's perfect. Thank you. ,09:20
1394,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,52,1,Interviewee ,"Get these three done. But money is the biggest thing. You know, another thing that in particular my  subdivision is dealing with is you know access to the water, the piped water because it's not there yet.  The sewer line comes within striking distance but the piped water is actually a good distance away. I think  there's a map towards the end there if you guys feel like referring to it. Yeah, so see it's actually got it right  there and the last few pages hopefully if I didn't jumble your packets up, but right here in the red is our  subdivision. And in the blue is where the pipe water exists, so we still have to get it over here to get, you  know, before we can move forward, and that's, you know, that's kind of something, that's the  responsibility of the city, you know, to get it there. And, you know, they have some challenges, you know,  to, they can't just move forward, you know, they have their own they have their own open loans, you  know, for their pipe system, and, you know, that's a kind of thing that they need to close out before they ",09:23
1398,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,53,1,Interviewee ,"open a new one. I know we're on their radar, and we make a lot of sense to move forward with because,  you know, we can partner and we can leverage and we get more funds and, and, and one of the things  that the community will benefit from is a proposed water treatment plant that would be right at the entry  of our subdivision, which would, you know, save the city a ton of money as far as getting people hauled  water to the outskirts of that area. So I think we did an analysis and it'd be about save them about three  and a half million dollars over the next 20 years or something in cash, and then and then another million  and something in maintenance and personnel and stuff like that. So it's, you know, the community would  benefit from it, not only just my subdivision, but the community as a whole. ",09:23
1402,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,53,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So everybody understands. So people would fill up trucks there. So like, for [REDACTED], you know,  instead of the trucks moving and going all the way back to the, you know, the either the [REDACTED] or  the [REDACTED] and then doing three houses at a time in [REDACTED], they wouldn't have to come back  as far and even saving that whatever, two miles is a lot of time And for maintenance. Well, that's  promising. Okay, so yeah, talked about. ",11:36
1399,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,53,1,Interviewee ,"You know, and takes a lot of coordination between, like us and the city to be on the same page to move  forward with this type of thing. So. And knowing you know, which funds each entity has access to and  making sure like I said, the funds even, if you get a grant, you know, the administration of them being in  mind. Make sure it flows correctly and it happens in a timely matter. ",12:10
1403,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,53,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, and apparently, right now, construction costs are like through the roof.  ",12:48
1400,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,53,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, we got some preliminary numbers, you know, in there for a feasibility. And it was 8 million to get  the pipe water to close enough within striking distance for our subdivision and then another 8 million to  pipe our subdivision. And that was before all the price hikes. Unfortunately, I imagine that that's going to  be at least 50% higher to 75% higher. ",12:54
1404,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,53,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. We talked to the city about the [REDACTED] project and trying to put pipes over there. And yeah,  that went from like 12 million to 43 million. Yeah, it was, and nobody can get anything. It's kind of the  problem. Yeah, it sounded like it's a tough time to do that. So you have been here a while in [REDACTED]?  Are you from [REDACTED]?  ",13:22
1401,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,53,1,Interviewee ,Born and raised in [REDACTED].  ,13:52
1405,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,53,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay, how have things changed over time with water delivery? ",13:53
1406,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewee ,"Over time, I mean, I've always lived in a hauled water house. And the only observation I can, I guess, at  this moment is it seems like there's a high strain on the water and sewer staff. I mean, whether it's  turnover or the amount of trucks they have, or whatever it is, that you know, for instance, they've  forgotten to pump my sewer several times. I have to call them and remind them or, or, you know, water  comes a day late, you know, and here I am using all my water up so, you know, so I can have access to  more water but I'm out for a day, you know, and maybe I was maybe I didn't notice those things. Maybe  they happened when I was younger but those are things that are definitely happening now. ",14:08
1412,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Do you? I mean, so you've seen the pipe expansion, though over time, right?  ",15:06
1407,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewee ,Sure.  ,15:12
1413,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewer 1 ,"That's been good in general, like, yeah. ",15:13
1408,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I actually lived in one of those areas before they had piped water. But uh, yeah, I mean. Yeah, when  I was younger, you know, the only packed area was the [REDACTED] area, you know, so I know that the  [REDACTED] has been since then. And, you know, that's, that's a huge step forward. And I guess the  [REDACTED] being planned and I don't know if they're moving forward or not. But you know, that's the  changes I observed. ",15:20
1414,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And the [REDACTED] corridor, that's the other big one. Yeah. ",15:57
1409,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewee ,That's a big one. Yeah. ,16:00
1415,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewer 1 ,I think that's probably what gets it closer.  ,16:01
1410,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, that's what moved it pretty close to us.  ",16:03
1416,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Within striking distance, yeah. ",16:06
1411,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,54,1,Interviewee ,What really makes us as a plausible next step. ,16:08
1422,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Do you know, where are the [REDACTED], like the pre maternal or the long term care facility, are those  on the pipes? ",16:15
1417,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewee ,I think so. You could look at the map and it actually.  ,16:22
1423,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay, because that's pretty close. ",16:26
1418,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewee ,The zoomed out map here does show. And it looks like it hits the pre maternal home and all those places. ,16:28
1424,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Because I mean, if it's making it to, like [REDACTED] that's like, a stone's throw from the new subdivision.  So let's see, weather? Seasonality? Do you have more problems in the winter than the summer or kind of  all the time? ",16:39
1419,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewee ,You talking pipe vs haul? ,17:08
1425,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewer 1 ,I guess it's talking about your experience. However you've had it either at your house or with planning? ,17:10
1420,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, well, you know, we see a lot of people that have trouble, like, in the cold winter months, their evac  tube might freeze up, and they can't get their sewer, there's, there's an evac tube on the sewer holding  tank. When that freezes up. They get, you know, blue tagged, which means we couldn't serve you. And  then often, a lot of times what happens is the pipes back up, and they freeze, and that's when they're  calling us to come fix it. So we see that a lot. You know, that's half education, you know, and then mostly  education. But yeah, and it's likewise for the water, you know, they still have a responsibility to clean  their, they're called overflows, when they fill the water, it overflows, when, when they're full, so they  know it's full. And those freeze too. So there's always chances that people do not get served, you know,  on their schedule. And if they miss their schedule, they have to actually pay extra to get their water, you  know, so ",17:17
1426,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewer 1 ,"how many, how many houses do you kind of manage? Who's calling you? how many people? ",18:31
1421,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,55,1,Interviewee ,"I mean, that I manage, I mean, we have close to 40 people in our homebuyer program. But like for  instance, the program I mentioned is an emergency repair program. And we help about 15 to 20 people  a year with emergency repairs, which includes access to water and sewer. It could be numerous different  things, whether they lacked the plumbing or there's a tank that fails, or there's a freeze up ",18:36
1431,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewer 1 ,but that's their house and they're tribal members that call you just for help. Not because it's your house.  It's not like ,19:15
1427,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewee ,"the ones I manage you know the maintenance responsibilities like for the homebuyers. It's their  responsibility to maintain it we don't luckily get a lot of those freeze up issues and stuff with ours for  numerous reasons. You know, the way it's plumbed and you know the education. You know turn that tank  heater on the day before the sewer truck comes and all that type of stuff. ",19:23
1432,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewer 1 ,I know all that stuff. All that stuff the hard way. ,19:56
1436,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewer 3 ,"When someone does call you, and there's a problem, and they need help with something, who do you  send out there? Do you have people on staff? Or do you have, you know, people that you typically call to  help? Do you ever have challenges finding people who can help? ",20:04
1428,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, we do that in house also with our staff. You know, but it's, it's one of those things that's as needed.  So it's not like a full time staff is sitting there waiting for it to happen. You know, so when, when  emergencies happen, they're usually pulled from an area, go address the emergency and come back. So  it does, you know, affect our schedule a little bit. Yeah, we tried to have like an on-call person, but, you  know, that never worked out. And [REDACTED] probably knows how hard it is to retain employees around  here. Any good ones, at least, and to keep a stable crew. But that's some of the issues that we deal with. ",20:19
1433,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewer 1 ,How big is your crew? How many employees? ,21:12
1429,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewee ,"Well, there's only three in administration, they do all the paperwork. And then there's only about  [REDACTED] people out there that are swinging hammers and doing repairs. ",21:16
1434,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewer 1 ,That's a bunch. The city would be happy to have [REDACTED] more people I'm sure. ,21:34
1430,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewee ,"Well, you know, there's about [REDACTED] of them that are dedicated to building new houses. And then  there's a few of them that are in like project management. And then there's like about [REDACTED] in our  rehab program, which is the people that usually respond to the emergencies. ",21:44
1435,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,56,1,Interviewer 1 ,Okay. You said turnover is an issue. How do you? How do you train those people? Where do they come  from? And ,22:04
1437,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,57,1,Interviewee ,"It's been hard to do any training the last couple of years because COVID. As you might imagine, the  construction stuff is more hands on. And you know, the virtual stuff doesn't work too great. But luckily,  we have places like [REDACTED] that train them for us. ",22:18
1441,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,57,1,Interviewer 1 ,I was gonna ask about that. Is that a pipeline for you? You get people? ,22:38
1438,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,57,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I mean, we love to see that on their application, you know, they're usually young guys that, you  know, they're energetic. And, you know, hopefully, they come and they, they want to do good, and we  steer them in the path that, you know, prevents them from being one of those numbers, turnover  numbers, you know. We do some in house training traditionally, you know, like I said, it hasn't happened  in a while. Cold weather building techniques is probably the biggest one that we that we, you know, get  our guys trained up on. ",22:41
1442,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,57,1,Interviewer 1 ,Who does that training? You guys do that in house? Or is there? ,23:27
1439,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,57,1,Interviewee ,"No, there's, you know, in order to get a residential endorsement, you know, to build homes, you have to  have done through a couple of different training institutes. [REDACTED] is one of the two people that do  it in the whole state [REDACTED]. So just even though we don't need that, that residential endorsement,  we like our guys to go in case they need it some day to go through the right channels. He does a pretty  awesome job of teaching. It's better than we could do in house. ",23:30
1443,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,57,1,Interviewer 1 ,"[REDACTED] used to do that, we had an energy guy that did the wrote the like a big manual. And so that  there's the I forget the state Builders Association or whatever, they took over a lot of that, but yeah, we  used to have someone who would come out here and do cold weather, cold climate building. ",24:07
1440,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,57,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I think that's, you know, like I said, when I used to swing the hammer, we did it. I think down there.  In the city hall or something I don't remember exactly. It changed since then. I've actually was trained  twice here.  ",24:29
1444,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,57,1,Interviewer 1 ,"[REDACTED] was the guy that used to come out there, but he wrote the lassive, like in my house for my  own house, I have the big manual, like flashing windows or whatever. Right, triple flashing everything.  Tremco acoustical ceilings and vapor barriers. Yeah, good deal. So, am I missing anything? How are we  doing? ",24:48
1453,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,58,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah, no, that's so on the on the training side usually, like the trainings are giving them the skills that they  need or you feel like there's some gaps in what the trainings provide ",25:18
1445,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,58,1,Interviewee ,"that particular training gives you most the skills you need to build a house properly. But I mean, it's not  touching on water and sewer too much, or electrical, but other than, you know, ceiling penetrations and  those mechanisms create you know, we that's why we kind of like contracted out the electrical and  mechanical. ",25:27
1449,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,58,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Did you put any, when the houses I don't know, probably like an architect designed the houses or  something? Did you contract that out? And was there thought about water tank location and size? And  because I've had to cut up old water tanks because they won't fit out the door? You know, that sort of  thing? ",25:59
1446,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,58,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, so nowadays, when they got those tanks that fit through the door, you know, and they're plastic, so  they last for a long time. So yeah, we have a mechanical room that we put everything in, we call it a  mechanical room, but like typically like three 400-gallon tanks that are connected together. You know, in  order to get them through the door, they kind of downsized to 400 gallon tanks, so you have to connect  according to how much water you need. And then of course, there's structure you have to add underneath  it to support the weight. And one of the things that's nice about these tanks is they actually got a hole like  in the middle of it in the design to allow for airflow behind the tank, because what you see a lot is when  people shove that tank in the back, you know, then that behind, there's a bunch of mold, you know,  because it gets cold back there and condensates and you know the tanks are sweating ",26:16
1450,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,58,1,Interviewer 1 ,So they're not cylinder tanks. They're the rectangle ones with the hole in the middle.  ,27:24
1447,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,58,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, that's the ones we prefer, yeah.  ",27:28
1451,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,58,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Like a square doughnut kinda. Do you know how much water, how big the tanks are? ",27:30
1448,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,58,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah they're, they come in 500's or 400's. So some, some houses we build need 1000 gallons. So we use  two 500s. Some of them need 1200. So we'll do three 400s. But typically, they come in 400 or 500. I think  the cylinder ones you're talking about are 300. ",27:39
1452,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,58,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah they're pretty small, and they take up a lot, they're not very space efficient. Kind of a problem if you  want to put three or four in a row, there's a lot a lot of space that isn't water there. ",27:59
1454,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,59,1,Interviewee ,That's what I got in my house. ,28:09
1459,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,59,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And then the other problem I've heard with if you got multiple tanks, sometimes the way that they fill it,  they got to transfer fast enough otherwise you fill up one tank, it overflows, and then the guy stops  pumping and then that tank drains into the other ones. ",28:13
1455,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,59,1,Interviewee ,Yeah that's what I deal with.  ,28:27
1460,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,59,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay, so that's a real thing.  ",28:29
1456,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,59,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah that's a real thing. You know they put, I don't know the piping up high, you know. So once one gets  higher, it starts draining to the other one, right? Because only one of the tanks has the overflow, it tells  the guy inside it's full so. I got that piping, but I didn't make it big enough you know, so it's not dumping  into the other tanks fast enough ",28:32
1461,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,59,1,Interviewer 1 ,if they're filling up 100 gallons a minute or whatever. ,28:57
1457,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,59,1,Interviewee ,"And you know, one of the ways that people try to get around that is valving up where the water comes  in. But for some reason the different trucks have different pumps or something and depending on the  truck that comes to pump me up, you know my valve doesn't work. Necking them down doesn't work for  smaller vehicles. ",29:02
1462,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,59,1,Interviewer 1 ,"You mentioned something too about when designing the houses about having, needing the structure  underneath. 1200 gallons of water weighs a little bit. Has that been a problem? Is that preemptive? like  what do you is that what does that do to houses? ",29:31
1458,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,59,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I mean it definitely puts pressure on it. You know? So luckily, you know, our engineers, you know,  we build our pads big enough, and they're being big enough, and then we put extra joists and, and for us,  it hasn't been a huge problem. I mean, houses are shifting so badly with the warming weather across the  whole town. So I think most of the housing shifting is due to warming whether rather than the sewer  tanks, but you know, I'm talking about one of our design houses not like around [REDACTED] where, where  I've seen tanks like falling through the floor, I mean, you know, they're sweating, their moisture is getting  on the structure, they're rotting and they're starting to fall through the floor, or they are pushing on the  foundation that doesn't have big enough pads or soft ground underneath. So it is an issue. It can be an  issue. ",29:54
1467,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,60,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And with the leveling too. One thing that a builder told me that kind of makes sense is that it's not it's not  even just the weight, it's the changing weight. Right? So if you're doing 1000 gallons once a week, you  know it's a couple of tons that that that also affects it too, how it's connected to the rest of the house how  those pads you know, are doing this. Yeah. ",31:02
1463,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,60,1,Interviewee ,"Even the sewer tanks, you know, they're often sitting in a marshy area, you know, either half buried or on  top of the ground and the change in weight, you know, I've seen them float a little bit you know, which  changes the grade you know, which could cause a freeze up but obviously if they're floating it's usually  warm out but you do have ice heave pushing them up sometimes. So there's lots of potential problems  with the tank system. ",31:29
1468,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,60,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Am I missing anything? This is different, this is good. ",32:12
1464,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,60,1,Interviewee ,"There's lots of good information in the packet. If you didn't ask, it's probably in there. ",32:20
1469,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,60,1,Interviewer 1 ,We might need to follow up with you ,32:26
1471,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,60,1,Interviewer 3 ,"Yeah. Yeah, this is really helpful ",32:31
1465,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,60,1,Interviewee ,"Some stats in there and some good narrative. And we've been lucky to have [REDACTED] you know,  partner with us. Actually, look at all the partners on the front. Yeah, there's a lot of collaboration to come  up with that little feasibility study. ",32:35
1470,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,60,1,Interviewer 2 ,"So in your transition from hauled to pipe, so you're planning for hauled right now. And then if pipe  becomes an option, you'll kind of transition into that. How is that I mean, that's kind of within keeping as  the piping expands throughout the city, it's just you get connected into the pipes and then they take away  the tanks if you don't need them anymore, is that kind of your plan or ",32:57
1466,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,60,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, like you said, we get the tanks that fit through the doors. So like once the piping hits, we're able to  take those tanks out, possibly reuse them because they're plastic. And same thing with the sewer tanks  you know, we've built the houses high enough so they're sitting on the ground so hopefully when we get  the pipe we can just take that sewer tank and move it pretty simply. ",33:17
1478,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewer 2 ,Is it fairly easy to retrofit the piping and everything in order to be piped over hauled? ,33:39
1472,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I'm not totally sure about that, you know, it's not quite my expertise. But we did design our homes  you know, with the plan of one day being piped you know, so that they're positioned where the proposed  pipes are going to be in the future. ",33:47
1476,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewer 1 ,That was a big issue in [REDACTED] because the houses are all every house is different and the grinder  pumps and pipes flowing uphill. ,34:07
1473,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewee ,"And that's what's nice about this study is that it did kind of identify where the like how the piping would  access all the houses. So we're able to see okay, let's set this house this way and this one this way. You  know, ",34:18
1477,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewer 1 ,Yeah that's kind of the beauty of having a planned subdivision instead of people just building a house  wherever. What else should I have asked you about? Am I missing? Anything you want us to know about  water infrastructure? ,34:33
1474,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewee ,Well a lot of good questions. ,34:54
1479,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewer 2 ,"We'll be around too, we're here til Tuesday. And then we're coming back every couple of. ",35:03
1481,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewer 3 ,"I was gonna ask a little bit. I mean, there's, I'm excited to read more and look at it in more detail, but you  have a lot of things in here of different funding sources and loans and grants. And just wondering if there's  any specific challenges or considerations with any of the funding? ",35:08
1475,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Well, besides coordinating like I already mentioned, one of the things we know we want to be  prepared for is having that preliminary engineering report, which a lot of funders want to see. So I do have  that in my budget. And one of the other things you know, while the city's trying to prepare for their water  expansion I know some funding sources want to see homes up before they fund you. So I'm just trying to  get my homes up and make sure I meet their threshold you know, to be eligible for their funding so ",35:25
1480,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,61,1,Interviewer 2 ,So you have to build it and then you get reimbursed for basically what you built? ,36:06
1482,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,62,1,Interviewee ,"I'm talking about the pipe water and sewer funding. They don't want to put pipes up when there's no  house there. They want to see homes. Which is, you know, this is why it's really hard to fund a subdivision  for piped. A lot of times you need the homes first.  ",36:10
1484,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,62,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Like a chicken or the egg problem. You got to put houses in with hauled water systems, just so you can  get pipes and then take it out. All right. Well, that's kind of it. I think we might be in touch with you if  you're willing.  ",36:33
1483,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,62,1,Interviewee ,Yeah no problem.  ,36:53
1485,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 3 ,62,1,Interviewer 1 ,That's great. Yeah. And I think a new kind of a different perspective than what we've been hearing so  that's just super useful. ,36:55
1486,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewee ,[REDACTED].  ,00:03
1491,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewer 2 ,"My name is [REDACTED]. And our research group looks at infrastructure and equity questions in kind of a  big scope. But this is the project I'm most excited about because it's working with, I love water systems.  That's where my background trainings in and so thinking about water access and water community use  and we're specifically focused on. ",00:50
1487,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewee ,"Cool. You guys are at [REDACTED]. I appreciate them high level universities. Yeah, I love going to school. I  wish I could start all over my life again and just go to school and get smart before I started instead of after. ",01:25
1492,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewer 2 ,I think everyone wished that. Going to school doesn't always give you the smarts you need. Right. ,02:18
1488,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewee ,That took me [REDACTED] years to finish my [REDACTED] certificate. I finally graduated from that last  spring. ,02:24
1493,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewer 2 ,Cool. Amazing. Did you do that here? ,02:31
1489,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewee ,Yeah. Here and there. [REDACTED]. That was pretty exciting.  ,02:34
1494,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewer 3 ,"Yeah, I'm [REDACTED]. So we're kind of a collaborative project here. [REDACTED]. And a lot of what I am  really passionate about is infrastructure management. But specifically making sure we're incorporating  kind of the end users and people who are going to use the system and capturing their perspectives. And  not just kind of saying, we'll design it just because it's how we we've been doing it.  ",02:42
1495,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewer 4 ,"I'm [REDACTED]. My background is actually in construction and kind of linking that with water and what  we're doing here, I'm really interested in the whole process and the people involved. You know, from the  start of something until the end of it, and especially with water here, you know, everyone who's involved  in getting water to people's homes and whatever way they're doing that. That's something that I get really  excited and interested in. And yeah, that's, that's who we are. ",03:14
1490,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,63,2,Interviewee ,"So I'm [REDACTED]. And I was born and raised in [REDACTED]. Water is so precious. And you know, they  say that you don't really appreciate water unless you carried it yourself. And we lived in dip water. We  had dip water and there were so many of us. I don't know how my mom managed to keep us as well as ",03:46
1496,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,64,1,Interviewee ,"she did. And limited water. And yeah, so and then the honey bucket. Honey bucket that should have been  immortalized someplace along the way long time ago, but shouldn't be alive and well here today. And my  big concern about water right now is our river and the Clean Water Act being violated by the state and  federal governments and granting these mining permits without proper consultation and looking at  scientific data and research on what big mining potential has to do with water. They're not protecting and  doing their due diligence in protecting our right to clean water. So that and in my work I've traveled to  every village in our region, except for [REDACTED]. And I started traveling working for my people at a time  when there was one telephone in the village and trying to arrange meetings and do things like that with  one phone in the village was really a challenge back then. It was the very beginning of that Comprehensive  Employment and Training Act monies coming into our region to create jobs for people. So I was working  for our regional nonprofit and I had started off with [REDACTED] on up and traveled to the villages and  realized you know considering it all in some ways, we had it pretty good in [REDACTED] but at the same  time living [REDACTED] I was very close to [REDACTED] and they had pumped water. But still water was  very precious. And I don't know, I always hope to God that we were safe from the, from the contaminated  water that they had found in [REDACTED] that had been contaminated by I think the FAA. So, they have  they had what PCBs they found PCBs in the water. And it was a challenge every day to pump enough water  for the family, it had to be water had to be pumped and lifted out of the basement in five-gallon buckets.  And when we did laundry if we could get that washing machine started because it had its own motor with  an exhaust pipe going outdoors it was a gas-fed motor because we didn't have electricity back in the  woods either. And that was a real big change to live in [REDACTED] and growing to appreciate it. But when  we do laundry there's, [REDACTED] and any stray that came in for laundry day. It started out pretty good.  Yeah, it started out pretty good. But by the time we were doing those last loads, we were just rearranging  dirt. And the clotheslines especially in the wintertime because we didn't have a dryer, we'd have to bring  in these frozen boards of clothes. And then the humidity in the house. So yeah, water I really appreciate  water. In fact, if you don't have water, it can ruin your whole vacation. And safe drinking water getting  back to my people has been a huge barrier to us even achieving a level playing field with the rest of the  country and even stabilizing our terrible health statistics. Yeah. So not only are we stricken with cancer,  diabetes, and heart disease, but we are the staph capital of the state. Because of limited water, our people  are more exposed to the steam bath boils because the best way to clean is to go take a steam. And once  you get those, those toxic bacteria in your steam. They're there. So that when I was on [REDACTED], when  I first got on it was a big deal in trying to get a barrier because you couldn't expect people to burn down  their steams and start all over again. That was just cost prohibitive. So water is big. It's a big it's a big issue,  and it's been an ongoing challenge in my lifetime ",03:46
1498,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,64,1,Interviewer 1 ,What are the biggest barriers to getting water to the people? ,09:54
1497,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,64,1,Interviewee ,"I think just finding it, finding good water. When I was on the school board, [REDACTED]. There are  [REDACTED] school districts in our region. So I was on [REDACTED]. And we were going through reports  from the facilities department and he was talking about these this big expense item that was showing up  for water in some cases, it's reverse osmosis. Some places it's well water. But it varies, because it's  [REDACTED] villages. And I said why do you need this increased filtration for heavy metals, the selenium  and all of those cancer metals and he said that the nuclear testing that Russia had done during the Cold ",10:02
1499,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,65,1,Interviewee ,"War came over in acid rain. And right now, [REDACTED] all of that acid rain was just reaching the water  table. So they needed better a better filters to get that out. And I don't know who's testing water in all  the different places in the region where that could be a problem but it's never been tested or followed up  on or Yeah, so we have a lot of risks to what water we do have. Another is and it used to just burn me on  [REDACTED] when they were always the professionals that come in from someplace else, like condemning  us for the amount of soda pop, soft drinks, Kool Aid, Tang. I said if you had to drink that village water you  would flavor it with anything you could too. And blaming us for the condition of our teeth and the  condition of our health because we're forced to drink this stuff. And rainwater. Our elders, to them  rainwater comes from heaven. This is pure water it comes from heaven. But nobody's telling them you  know, the birds [REDACTED] on your roof. And there's acid rain. And we were told at the school district  that this it's strong enough to corrode pipe and they're making tea out of it because it came from heaven  with no filters. So the education isn't all there either. The awareness end and even the means to filter  your water. [REDACTED]. So those are challenges real, real real challenges and obstacles with the lack of  infrastructure. The State of Alaska is not fond of funding projects they consider rural Alaska a burden to  the state while they have all these extraction industries that's [REDACTED] our land and polluting our  water and our air and killing our fish.  ",10:02
1502,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,65,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Do you think there's a role for traditionally gathered water, ice, rainwater, water from the river or would  you would your vision be pipes or water plants? Is there what what's your what's your vision? How would  you want things to be? ",14:14
1500,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,65,1,Interviewee ,"I remember getting blocks of ice from the river. I'd rather not see pipes. But if there is if that's what it  takes, if that's what it because the ground is so unstable right now. Climate change has affected. Alaska is  at ground zero for climate change because of the permafrost melting. In fact last summer I went out to a  place that I normally walk. And with my walking stick, I couldn't believe how deep into the tundra it went  and it wouldn't normally be that deep it would be frozen. But that's how unstable our ground is. So having  pipe you got to have that support base to make sure that the pipes aren't breaking every time there's a  frost heave. And look at what's happened [REDACTED]. I was in high school, junior high when they put the  water the first system up in [REDACTED]. First of all, they put all the houses on the ground. They had only  one exit and they had those oil cookstoves. And the piping, they had little lift stations. But we lost so many  people in fire because they had no way to get out of their houses. So many people so they had to do they  had to do another exit. This is like the fourth or fifth system that they put in place. I think the first I think  the very first one was underground. And then when I started working in [REDACTED], they were putting  in the new, everybody was on water, delivered water. Because the system had failed the first system it  had failed in [REDACTED] and they had brought in all these all these dollars and had to build the new  above. ",14:33
1503,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,65,1,Interviewer 1 ,"When they were delivering water at that time. It was not like, was that dip water? So it's not ",16:58
1501,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,65,1,Interviewee ,Not like now. ,17:07
1509,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewer 1 ,We talked about piped water and hauled water but it wasn't like there was a thing to your toilet. It was  like a thing on your porch.  ,17:11
1504,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewee ,God help us if the honey bucket driver and the dip water guy come in at the same time and they gotta  pass. Yeah. And we had water delivered but we dumped our honey buckets wherever we could in the  little lake behind the house until somebody came in and told us that's not the way to do things. ,17:20
1510,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So what about just you got a lot of history here. This is interesting. So for you, you had water where they  would deliver water, it was treated water. But it was in like a basin, you know, like a big tub. ",17:48
1505,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewee ,55-gallon drum. ,18:03
1511,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewer 1 ,55-gallon drum okay. And then what was next? What was the next change that you had with your water? ,18:04
1506,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewee ,"Well, it was like overnight, [REDACTED] and we had piped water and running water overnight. Yeah, and  [REDACTED] kids that grew up with no manners. We didn't have a lot of male, [REDACTED]. And there was  no dad. ",18:11
1512,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewer 1 ,"He took on a lot, huh? ",18:40
1507,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, he sure did. [REDACTED] Wow, flush toilet. ",18:42
1513,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewer 1 ,Do you feel like that was a good change? ,19:20
1508,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,66,1,Interviewee ,"Well, yeah, we didn't have to take baths in the same water anymore. We could do laundry on a regular  basis. We could cook. I mean there was kitchen sinks and we didn't have to heat up water on the stove. It  was a big, big step up in our quality of life and I'm the oldest. [REDACTED] I loved living in the woods and  doing the things we did to live, having woodstove and even the challenges made it worthwhile, because I  was that much closer to the earth and my family homelands. So it gave me another appreciation, but it  was nice to have an outhouse. I'd rather have an outhouse than a honey bucket. [REDACTED] ",19:21
1516,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,67,1,Interviewer 1 ,So you went from having like dip water to having a flush toilet and running water but then you went to  [REDACTED] and there's an outhouse there. So you kind of took a step in the other direction. But that was  okay?  ,21:25
1514,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,67,1,Interviewee ,"You find ways, you find ways like I would put a big one of those big five-gallon enamel pots on my house  stove. So I had hot water and I got you know I could bend arms with my nephew. Because I would pack in  so much water in and out of the house. ",21:40
1517,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,67,1,Interviewer 1 ,Where were you getting the water in [REDACTED]? ,22:08
1515,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,67,1,Interviewee ,"Well first of all we went and begged water wherever we could because we moved up in the middle of  winter but the next year [REDACTED] drove a while. And it was so nice to have that as [REDACTED] went  over to him one day and he said you know she heats up her water before she does laundry. [REDACTED]  hot water will clean them Clorox really cleans things good. But yeah, you find ways to adapt and living  [REDACTED] always made it worthwhile. And now we have a cabin farther up where we have our family  homelands. [REDACTED] I said you know if we put rain gutters up that would be half the job right there  you don't have to go to the river or to the creek to get water. So it starts raining and I'm out of water and  I don't have to say anything. Well I hope it's on top of his list this year because last year there was a lot of  other stuff going on at the same time that we were [REDACTED] and when I found my new wood stove is  such a well-made little stove that it's so insulated that I can't heat water on it. I can touch the top of it  when it's going. [REDACTED] gave me her broken down propane stove. But only two burners don't work  on that and it has an oven that doesn't work either. [REDACTED] So when I found myself heating up water  so we had drinkable water and using those precious propane resources to heat water, I said it's time to  go home. And we do have a little we have two creeks we have the main creek that's right by us that's close  that we're okay with for cleaning and is good, but a little bit farther up. There's another little creek that  isn't exposed as much to the air as this one. Because this one is coming straight from the [REDACTED]  mountains. But this other one is being filtered until oh maybe about was a long time ago that I walked  back because I was trying to find out where it started from. But what it was like this wall of all of these  little sprinkly things that were being fed from the mountain. Feeding and then yeah. So that's and probably  a couple of drops of Clorox wouldn't hurt. So a new appreciation for water and finding any way you can.  And then I go down to meetings where tribal people are in America. And our brothers and sisters, our  tribal brothers and sisters are fighting desperately for their water rights. Before COVID, we went down  there and one of the rancheros was saying how they were so afraid they weren't going to get their water  for their farms. That they asked whoever if they could store their amount of water in some lake. And they  said no, because that lake is for emergency purposes. That's how desperate they are for water, and their  rights to water. And the whole lake [REDACTED] drying out, and [REDACTED]. And no snow cover coming  down the mountains to feed these people in the [REDACTED] that don't know how to pack their water.  Things are getting desperate in America. So we have to protect what we have here. And that Clean Water  Act is the only thing we have right now. But the state of Alaska does want to protect our rights to that  they want to Alaska is open for business and we don't care who we step on who we destroy who we kill.  To get to these resources. Because the people that are in power are not here. They're living in places ",22:10
1518,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,68,1,Interviewee ,where they have the comfort of going hunting at Fred Meyers or cars or someplace else. We don't have  any place else to get our food except for the land and the water here. And people are so happy right now  because the geese are here. And we don't know if we're going to be able to fish. Last summer they shut  down the whole [REDACTED] river. The entire [REDACTED] river was shut down for salmon. We depend  on salmon to live. Salmon is in our DNA and law enforcement the state and federal law enforcement was  going fish camp to fish camp to make sure not one fish was hanging in anybody's smokehouse.  ,22:10
1522,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,68,1,Interviewer 2 ,Why did they shut it down? ,28:36
1519,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,68,1,Interviewee ,"Because of the low chum runs the high trawlers in the seas. Their incidental bycatch of our fish. Yeah, we  have a lot of challenges and survival right now is becoming an issue. With climate change, trawlers getting  our fish out there is incidental bycatch before they even get here. The mine looming over us and we don't  even know if we'll have clean water that the fish want to come home to. And we already know we're going  to be limited with fish this summer and if you're living here and you catch one king salmon it better not  leave the region because we're down to bare subsistence fishing and survival.  ",28:37
1521,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,68,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Can I ask you a question? It's interesting to me about kind of your water experiences through your life.  You know, moving on to have a flush toilet or running water and all that. That seems like something that  was good but I'm also kind of hearing that you enjoy some of the tradition you know you enjoy packing  water a little bit. Am I hearing that right? ",29:34
1520,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,68,1,Interviewee ,"Well when you're out being close to nature there's a connection there. When you're doing things at that  level, it brings you closer to what's real, and what needs to be protected. And I've talked in many venues  over the past [REDACTED] years about food security. And my people don't have the luxury of going to a  store and know that everything they need is going to be at that store, they might find chips, canned goods,  if they're lucky, maybe when the plane just comes, there might be some fruit. There might be an onion,  you'll be lucky if there's celery, lettuce, tomatoes, those kinds of foods, those are a luxury. And if the stock  gets frozen on its way, there's no way to recoup that. There's no guarantees for food security. And I tell  people, you know, I have more of a spiritual connection with this fresh king salmon that comes out of the  [REDACTED]. Or that first piece of moose meat in the fall time. Or those first picked berries than I have  with something I can order from McDonald's. I'm connected spiritually to that food, because I've taken  care of it. From the time I got it, til the time it's coming into my body. And I don't know what happened to  what's happening with that food I get from McDonald's or what's all in that calf. And [REDACTED] has  studies, research that's been done, saying that our health and well-being is directly connected to our  access to our customary traditional food sources. And that means having clean water. ",30:01
1523,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,68,1,Interviewer 3 ,"Yeah, definitely. So where do you think that you're more concerned with kind of the clean water and rivers  in the natural environment than necessarily being able to treat it and pipe it to the homes? Or do you  think kind of where you're. ",31:59
1524,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,69,1,Interviewee ,"I think you'd have to look at the whole big picture. Yeah. And nobody's on that level playing field yet. So  how can we all say that we're equal when we're not all there yet? I remember years ago, going down to  [REDACTED] conference in [REDACTED]. And it was Native leaders from all over the state working for, staff  like me, working for nonprofits to come together with what were our legislative priorities, and we're all  at tables. And this one lady, this beautiful, Tlingit lady came to our table, and she wanted to interrupt us  to ask us if we would present a proposal for her. And this was about building another gathering community  center, down in southeastern. So in southeastern Alaska, those were like the first people to become  exposed to Western. And they'd have a lot of time to organize and be good be together, they live in a  temperate environment that doesn't have the extreme weathers that we have, they have access to  resources, the ocean is their table. So she's trying to sell us on taking that into our group and presenting  it as a priority to the whole group that we're going to present to legislature and I looked at her I said, you  know, my people don't even have flush toilets and running water. I can't, in my right mind, I can't support  something like this, a Taj Mahal, down in southeastern when my people don't even have flush toilets and  running water. So the state of Alaska too, has got those differences in in the way we're served. So I think  it's going to have to be looking at the big picture and what can we do here? Because it's going to be totally  different than what we're gonna do there.  ",32:16

1532,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,70,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, yeah, yeah. And they'll the city of [REDACTED] will let us do it I think once a year, they'll let us do that  change for free. And then you can order like 250 gallons extra if you happen to need it. But every house  from my, from what I understand your water tank has to pass your septic tank has to hold like 250 to 300  gallons more than what the capacity of your water tank is. So that's pretty easy to take in. You know, being  a responsible homeowner and making sure that they have access and it's clear, and it's clean. And our  inside stuff is good. We filter our water; we filter it when it comes out of the tank and we filter it before  we drink it. And let me tell you those filters get really black. Yeah. And though our water is so screwy when  I started playing around with my hair because my mom thought I was making her look too old because I  didn't want to dye it. The water, what was in my hair from the water did really strange things with the  different kinds of dyes. Yeah, this one time I wanted to get a henna and [REDACTED].

1539,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,70,1,Interviewer 2 ,Do you think have they learned lessons that they wouldn't have learned otherwise because of that? I  mean that exposure to water conservation that they might not have seen otherwise? ,39:44
1536,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,70,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, because when they go back to their families that have never had to pack their own water they go  and like the first time we went [REDACTED]. But we have to turn the generator on. Yeah. Well [REDACTED]  shows up and going what's wrong with the toaster? What do you mean? I plugged it in and it won't work  I said well, the toaster only works if the generators running. Oh the rest of the time it just sits there and  looks pretty. So then we got to do laundry.

1545,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,71,1,Interviewer 1 ,"It's actually a comment that we heard from somebody else was that you know, it's a little bit of a maybe  a downside from getting all the nice water systems was that kids don't learn to pack water. They might  get lazy they might not have respect for that. Like kind of miss out on that and so that's a little bit of like  a you know, like a cultural loss or like loss of character to not grow up with that. ",42:21

[REDACTED] So, yeah, kids don't and I have to try really hard with my grandchildren too because if there's  only one person that's enforcing that. And one of the other things too, I learned with my [REDACTED]  studies is looking at culture it's so very important for the woman's place because the woman is the one  that teaches the way things are in the home.

There's  because there are some times when they haven't come till Sunday night. And that's, you know, we do  expect that especially with the pandemic, and we know, because we listen to the news that the city is and  God bless them through the pandemic, they never shut down. It was amazing that they were able to keep  their workforce going. And I tried to make it a special point. But it was so hard to try to give them  something without worrying about contagion, you know, I have to get stuff that was in packages or cans  and have a wipe and make sure that they weren't going to get sick because I gave them something. But I  think they're underappreciated, very much under appreciated. ",47:50

1551,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 4 ,72,1,Interviewee ,"Uh, well, I don't know, because I don't know the science behind what it would take. Yeah. And the  filtration, I know that it's not going to be a Brita or a Pur that's going to take that stuff out. It's going to be  something that's got a little more, a little more, a little more muscle to it, but having that available so that  people can take those extra steps to make sure their water is healthy. And especially for babies. We have  so many diseases that our children get the RSVs all the respiratory stuff. It's like there's because of sanitary  conditions and the lack of water. ",49:18

And like  community meetings, the show and tell stuff, home to home even. Yeah, that's what it's gonna take. You  know, there are places down in the states where people can't even collect rainwater? Yeah, Yeah, that's  how desperate things are. We went down to the Grand Canyon in the late very late 80s or early 90s. And  it was wonderful. The very first time I ever went myself was 1980. It was the first time I went to the dam,  we went, we went inside, we were able to go inside. And it was pretty awesome to see something like  that. But when we went back I think it was six years ago. And we did that same loop. We went from  Nevada, down to New Mexico to Arizona, California and came back up again. But we did the Grand  Canyon. And it was it was heartbreaking. It was absolutely heartbreaking that this is this is what we  brought ourselves to. And I worry about the glaciers in Greenland when they have those meltdowns. And  the earth and the magnetic pole moving all over the place. And when's the tip going to come, to reset the  balance? And our elders talking about the Earth, the skin of the Earth is getting thin. A lot of this is stuff  that they've seen through and seeing the signs in nature that those changes that are happening that are  very, very scary. And this extreme weather the erosion. Some of our villages are going to, I don't know  once the permafrost melts, what they're gonna see. And our tundra is like a sponge.

There's, yeah, real problems with water collecting and not having a place to go where the culverts are  frozen. Yeah. Poor planning. It's just poor poor planning on the city's part because of staff turnover. And  like, they were wanting to open a liquor store down the road. They would change the auto repair shop to  a liquor store. I said, Who are you? Where did you come from? How long have you been here? He didn't  even go through town to know that this is a well-established snowmachine route from [REDACTED].

1682,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,87,1,Interviewee ,"would. Because our delivery date is [REDACTED]. We're home. So we can easily see that we didn't get  filled up. [REDACTED], we'll give you the grace of an extra day. And then, man, [REDACTED], I'm in the  office and I'll take care of it. [REDACTED] He's the practical hands on guy, I'm the money, the computer,  getting the grants. He's administering them, carrying them out.  ",05:43

1684,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,87,1,Interviewee ,"We're still working on [REDACTED]. There's some glimmer of hope there. [REDACTED] said. We might  push, you know, for an [REDACTED] grant. If we can fund it, if we want to. ",06:33

You know, maybe go out to bid again in six months or a year, so we might lower it  down. But if USDA will get us that much money, it'd be nice to know that we're not limited to [REDACTED].  If we [REDACTED]. Okay. Now, a year from now. And anything less than that we could do.  ",06:48

So we have a preliminary engineering report done. The preliminary engineering report said  there's a sewage, and it recommended alternative three. And I get you a copy of the PERs. You want a  copy of the PERs?  ",07:21

1591,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,77,1,Interviewee ,"A lot of supporting documents, I'm not writing at all. Here's my request. And here's this this study. You  know, we had a we had a study that showed [REDACTED] wanted by the community. Any, here's the here's  the proof that we taxed ourselves. [REDACTED]. ",08:15
1695,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,88,1,Interviewer 1 ,"[REDACTED] And if it's too big to send from an email perspective, I can come back with a flash drive.  ",08:17

1595,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,77,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. Okay. Okay. And in any of that, did you have to demonstrate so you I mean, support for it all that?  Did you have to demonstrate ability to maintain and run it over time? How does that kind of like? ",08:59
1694,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,88,1,Interviewee ,"What was the question? Oh, yeah PER. So [REDACTED] engineer firm is revitalizing a cost estimate,  producing a technical memo to add on to the preliminary engineering report that's going to describe the  cost estimate and I need deficiency language. I need [REDACTED] to come up with some more bad pipe  language. Like water pipes are bad in this way. Probably won't last, you know, whatever kind of. Yeah.  And this spot. It said something about assessment in there. Yeah. So the preliminary engineering report  said the conditional assessment is beyond the scope of this project. It should be recommended. Well,  when the reviewers at the state level reviewed it. They said ah, this preliminary engineering report's not  complete. It needs a conditional assessment. So only phase one or phase two. Oh man, it's just caused a  monkey wrench. Yeah, it wasn't perfect. I can't go get funding directly with this thing. Okay, so what the  city's doing is we're paying [REDACTED] to get the conditional assessment done now. Give me everything  I need. So I can go in there full bore, and go get this money right now while the infrastructure money's  pouring down on us. Billion, 2 billion coming to Alaska. Got to grab it. Yeah, 2 billion to Alaska. So I'm going  to put into the [REDACTED]. And then it goes in. We're also having the engineer who works for [REDACTED]  enters information into the [REDACTED]. Database. And it has to be in there first anyways, for [REDACTED]  to be funded, but what the state's trying to do is take this windfall of infrastructure, and say all the  [REDACTED] projects in our huge database of 700-800 projects, all water and sewer, all these water and  sewer projects. [REDACTED] means ready to go. All the deficiencies are there, everything. These are the  high needs. These are Everything's ready. fundable projects. So we're working real hard to make  [REDACTED], fundable. Get rid of that little problem of conditional assessment, get the assessment done,  get everything in there get the language, move it up. Right now it's [REDACTED], move it up to a  [REDACTED]. Woo, we want to be funded too. Get that whole thing funded. That would be a huge success.  Because people in [REDACTED] have been screaming for years coming into Council. ""Look at this brown  water! I can't believe it, the city's giving me brown water."" Well, they don't change their filter. You know,  there's some things they don't do. But yeah, it's a public display looks bad. We get a lot of complaints.  ""Look at this T shirt. This used to be white. How am I supposed to go to work with a T shirt like this. You  got to fix the water."" So at least we'll show we're doing something over there. You know, place some  pipes, get some water, it will be more efficient, the water will run a little faster, because we're going to ",08:59
1699,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,89,1,Interviewee ,"break one loop. [REDACTED]. So it will circulate faster and quicker. And we're gonna hook up [REDACTED]  new houses. You know, part of the [REDACTED], water and sewer. [REDACTED] project is hooking up  [REDACTED] new with a brand new pipe from the plant. So we're not using the steel pipes anymore. Brand  new HDPE.

1592,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,77,1,Interviewee ,"just said we're a big city, we have [REDACTED] in the bank. You know, we have a budget, we have  [REDACTED] budget. Yeah. We are able to manage ourselves. Yep. I explained that to, you know, the state  capital grants. There is no formula. There's no, there's no application. Yeah, yeah, whatever you want to  put in. So I kind of made up my own nine questions that I always answer. That provided all the information  that I thought they needed based on other grants. what is the need? Description? Yeah, common stuff.  ",09:10
1596,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,77,1,Interviewer 1 ,that's awesome. You mentioned a couple of water related grants. Can you tell us about those? ,09:42
1593,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,77,1,Interviewee ,"Well, that was a sewer grant. Sewer lagoon. Water lift stations, sewer lagoon also. Now the [REDACTED]  really is the only water one. You guys, [REDACTED], did those guys tell you about the [REDACTED]?  ",09:48
1597,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,77,1,Interviewer 1 ,Were you part of that grant writing?  ,10:05
1594,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,77,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah yeah. I'm the one who wrote the [REDACTED] loan application. [REDACTED]. They formalized the  grant loan for us. Yeah. That's all online process when they first came out with this [REDACTED]. Online  Application. All these supporting documents in there and certifications and all this information about city  of [REDACTED]. Okay. So they gave us the [REDACTED] project. Here's your grant, you know, [REDACTED]  in loan, here's your [REDACTED] in grant money. That's what it's supposed to cost. According to the  preliminary engineering report done by [REDACTED]. So the cost was lower than [REDACTED] that they  thought we needed in contingency. And having, this being the second time going after [REDACTED] grants.  It's a little bit insidious what they do. They add this huge contingency hoping you don't use it. And then  they take the grant money back. I'm like, Ah, force us to use the loan money first. We have to use the loan  money first. You're guaranteed paying all that money back, and then [REDACTED] in grant money, all the  contingencies. So high. Only needed [REDACTED] in grant money that you thought you were gonna get,  you don't get. ",10:06
1603,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,78,1,Interviewer 1 ,Yeah. Yeah. That's and then they told us that the actual bids and all that now are like. ,11:37
1599,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,78,1,Interviewee ,[REDACTED] was the second. We only got two bids. [REDACTED]. For the same project. That was  [REDACTED] three years ago. It wasn't even [REDACTED].  ,11:45
1604,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,78,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And what do you is that I mean, what do you think's causing that inflation in the cost of  between? Is it COVID? Is it supply chain? ",12:03

China shutting down shutting down  all their factories for COVID. not producing anything, not moving anything. I mean, so much comes from  China. When they shut down the world feels it. Yeah. [REDACTED] I mean, all the programs coming out.  The infrastructure money, the COVID. Millions and billions of COVID money. I mean, I turn around I get  COVID money. [REDACTED] grants of COVID. [REDACTED]  ",12:13
1705,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,89,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. And that's separate? [REDACTED] does not include the new [REDACTED] development, right? ",12:55
1700,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,89,1,Interviewee ,"No, no. We tried to push them to get piped right away. It was unsuccessful.  ",13:00
1601,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,78,1,Interviewee ,"We spent it. Because it's [REDACTED]. If someone says here man, you can have this if you can spend it. All  right. We'll spend it. We came up with all kinds of stuff. Airport incentive program. Well, we'll get $25  coupons. $25 gift certificates from restaurants. So we're supporting local businesses, we'll pay people and  [REDACTED] actually ran this program. [REDACTED]. Yeah. Hired all these people went to the airport, two  or three of us. People got off the plane. Hey, welcome to [REDACTED]. $25 if you get tested, we encourage  you to get tested. Everybody coming into town. We can't force you. Please get tested. Get tested. Here's  $25 if you get tested. As soon as they got tested in the little thing, they got a little card thing. [REDACTED]  made this thing. We were on the other side going, we were telling them about it then we were giving  them the coupon. Supports local businesses. $25 Whether they spend it or not, the money is already in  there. Already purchased. Yeah, exactly. So it helps the restaurant. And we got a lot more test results.  [REDACTED] got a lot more test results. They were able to identify more people with COVID. So that's one  of the many programs we did with the [REDACTED]. We also spent some on was it water or sewer? Lift  station money. Sewer. What else do we do for water? We did get a grant.  ",13:01

1706,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,89,1,Interviewer 1 ,Is that because of a finance thing or what's the? ,13:08
1701,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,89,1,Interviewee ,"Well, partly. USDA only funds ready-made buildings. They won't fund a water and sewer project that  doesn't hook up to anybody. So it's like, we can't get money to lay it out ahead of time. And we haven't  been successful forcing the developer to do that, you know, lower 48 Hey, you're the developer. You put  in the pipes, water and sewer pipes. And we'll, we'll turn it on and make sure it's the city standard.  ",13:10

1702,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,89,1,Interviewee ,"[REDACTED], he's developing it right now. It's called [REDACTED] subdivision. [REDACTED]. So that we  don't, he doesn't have to build the pipes anymore. We had it in there that the developers got to put in  the pipes. So now it's our responsibility.

But [REDACTED] owns this piece, around it. So he wants a road like this. And  then another road like this. [REDACTED] You don't have to go through someone's yard. Go through an  open property and put a playground here. You know, tried to accommodate. They had it like this. Like,  you know, originally all the water was gonna drain into [REDACTED].

So all you know, [REDACTED] sitting around and they discuss all these  issues. Sometimes it amounts to a complaint session about city not doing this, this, and this. So we sit  there and listen to them saying how bad city is. Nothing really gets done in that environment. We just sit  there and listen. Oh, well, you know, we try we're doing this we're doing that. So yeah, not very ",19:18

Yeah, but just it seems like the city goes through more effort to try to arrange things. Try to get them  there or try to make a meeting. Yeah, they cancel, they reschedule. Yeah, the clerk has a heck of a time  trying to line things up and get it going. ",19:18

1629,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,81,1,Interviewee ,"It was the [REDACTED]. Because they were really wanting to get out of the water business. The  [REDACTED] was somewhat vocal, but [REDACTED] really went to bat for us. I mean, anything we wanted,  support letters. They hated, don't make us use our own well. It's terrible.

1630,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,81,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. And I don't think it was that good. Yeah, it was either theirs or the [REDACTED]. One of them was  like, for every 100 gallons, they got 15 usable. I mean, it was poor quality water coming out of the well. I  can't remember. Oh, it might have been the [REDACTED] as well. It might have been the same water. I  don't know. They both had problems. They did not. [REDACTED] was reluctant. You know, they, we had  to kind of really push them. Yeah. To accept our we don't know if your water's good enough. We're  [REDACTED]. Water has to be certain purity. Certain, you know, it's like, we meet all your requirements.  We finally convinced them and now they're really happy because they're out of the well business too. And  they can put it all to bed and focus on being a [REDACTED]. ",21:14

1726,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,91,1,Interviewer 2 ,"It's my favorite question, it's the easiest one on our part. ",21:25
1722,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,91,1,Interviewee ,"Well, the latest thing that we're starting to look at commercial. Like [REDACTED]. They have their own  well, too. So hooking up [REDACTED] could allow us to make some revenue as part of the [REDACTED]  project. This is kind of [REDACTED] brainstorm. Hey, make sure we hook up [REDACTED]. So we're looking  at an economic development grant. And they want two things. They want employment, because of the  water and sewer show us increased employment. And private investment. So [REDACTED] was  considering a bottle plant, a bottling plant, you know, hey, fresh [REDACTED] water, [REDACTED],  whatever they want to call it. It's gonna sell. If they set up that, more employment, bigger. They're  investing their own money in the nice infrastructure. They do a bottling plant, they're using the unlimited  water for their plant. Perfect way to grow the city. Perfect project for [REDACTED]. And then I attach all  the other commercial places. [REDACTED] They came out here one year, and they said, and they gave me  a document that helped me get money for something for another water sewer project. But she said, six  months. Stuff from the surface could reach the groundwater table. You know, it is possible. When I first  got here it's frozen, permanently frozen ground. Yeah, doesn't matter what we do on top we spill some  oil. Not gonna get down to the water table. She said, Oh, it can. And now with global warming. What's  happening is there's ice lenses, you know, they drill down. If you ever get a chance to see a geotech survey  of [REDACTED], water, sands, sands, silt, silty sand ice lens, sands. there's ice, there's cracks, there's ",21:30
1727,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,92,1,Interviewee ,"fissures. It's all sand. Basically different types of sand. But water could trickle down in six months to the  water table. That could theoretically contaminate our water source. We're not going to be drinking out of  the river. I mean, that is a huge expensive project to clean that up.  ",21:30
1635,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,81,1,Interviewer 1 ,So they don't do any more water production? ,22:00
1631,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,81,1,Interviewee ,"No, I think it's completely shut. Yeah, I mean, there may be some reserve if the city stops, but I really think  every day they get more and more success it's going to remain shelved, and yeah, they won't look at it  anymore. We're not going to stop producing water one way or another. Everybody has to have water.  Yeah, we have [REDACTED] wells. There's like [REDACTED] wells in town. I mean, there are other private  wells. So it's not like we're the only game in town. We're the only public water source. ",22:02
1641,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewer 1 ,That's something that [REDACTED] had mentioned or [REDACTED] had mentioned was that with the lack  of drivers though they're struggling to get some of the hauled water needs filled.  ,22:35
1636,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewee ,Yeah we'd love to be out of the hauled water business completely. ,22:47
1642,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewer 1 ,So if you like if you had a choice for the whole city you'd put everyone on pipes? ,22:50
1637,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewee ,Piped. Yeah. Everybody on pipe. HDPE pure clean water pipes. The galvanized steel is causing us a lot of  problems. The plastic pipe lasts 50 years or more. Clean water. A lot easier to fix a lot easier to maintain.  Lasts a long time. It's all above ground. ,22:53
1643,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Is there money for that? Is there money? are you gonna, are there grants? ",23:14
1638,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewee ,Yeah.  ,23:18
1645,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewer 2 ,Do you have piped at home? ,23:21
1639,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewee ,"No, I'm on hauled. The good thing about being on hauled is I don't have the ugly pipes in my yard. That's  the only downside. You got all these ugly pipes come in your yard. [REDACTED] is ugly. You drive through  the neighborhood, ugh. They don't even use the yard space. Nobody plays in the yard because it's a  swamp. Nobody wants to fill it in. Nobody wants to put. Because you got to climb over. You can't even  climb over. [REDACTED] is so much more conducive. Because most of the pipes are on the ground. On the  ground on sleepers. Sleeper pads and that's what we're going to do with the [REDACTED]. Most of them  are gonna be on the ground too. Except in the flood area where we have to be elevated X number of feet.  Got to keep the pipe above the possible floodwaters. So yeah, if it's on the ground at least you can make  a ramp take your four-wheeler over it, snow machine in the wintertime, kids can run and jump over it you  know?  ",23:23
1644,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. Okay, so there is money for the extension of I mean, eventually pipes. The goal is to get pipes for  the entire. ",24:20
1731,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,92,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Do you have I mean, they're from like, the [REDACTED], and we've also heard about a report that was  done on the water infrastructure that I guess as a result of that they like lined the pipes with a chemical  sealant to stop some of the corrosion? Are those reports publicly available somewhere?  ",24:22
1640,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,82,1,Interviewee ,"Well [REDACTED] in his infinite wisdom said why are we piecing, why are we doing it neighborhood by  neighborhood? Yeah, let's push the PER. Let's get a preliminary engineering report for the whole town at ",24:28
1646,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,83,1,Interviewee ,"once. And we were able to get that going. Yeah, pushed it through and everybody seems to like it. So  we're paying for preliminary engineering. Actually, we're not paying. No, I got another loan. Right. Yeah,  yeah, I got a loan for they're gonna reimburse like, like 90% of it. So, like a grant. It's a state revolving loan  fund. They reimburse X amount which turns into a kind of like a grant. So we got a state revolving loan  fund. Anyway, if you guys need numbers, I can give you detailed numbers from my office. I can email it all  tomorrow. ",24:28
1728,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,92,1,Interviewee ,Yeah I got all that stuff. Some of those are giant. ,24:39
1732,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,92,1,Interviewer 1 ,Or just like a link or something like whatever wherever we can find. ,24:48
1729,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,92,1,Interviewee ,"Because of brown, like I said, people in [REDACTED] say brown water. So they did a study. They found out  the water's potable. So it's drinkable. We can't. If it was a health issue. I can get money easily. You know,  I mean, that helps. Like, in [REDACTED] right now, when it's gravity feed sewer system contrasting  compared to [REDACTED] which is grinder pumps at each house. [REDACTED] is all gravity fed. So they got  to have it up here and it goes down and slopes. But it freezes. It goes so slow. And there's not enough in  there and it builds up builds up builds up. So we have sections of sewer pipe that freezes. How do you  thaw it out and get it working again, in the middle of winter, when it's 20 below? You go break it apart,  cut it open, or we have areas where we can disconnect the pipe. And we spray it with a fire hose. So  sewage is spraying all over the place. We stick the hose in the pipe, we've got a special hose now that just  does this. Thaw it all out, put it back together again, turn it back on. And then we do it again. Each time  we break apart the pipe and spray sewage on the Tundra, we have to file a notice of violation on ourselves.  So we fill out and violate you know, DEC, Department of Environmental Conservation. Yeah. What was  going on the tundra, which is really private property. You know, but it's, we say it's tundra. It is. So we got  all these violations. I got a whole stack of those. I'm using those for the [REDACTED]. That's part of what's  gonna help me get money. You know, those violations? That's what got us the free PER for that area was  those violations. Gave us [REDACTED] Those violations are gold to me, the grant writer. You know, that's  how the system works. Health and safety first priority. Here's the safety issue. You want us spraying sewer  all over the place? Let us fix the pipes. Let's get it moving. ",24:53
1649,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,83,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Perfect. That sounds great. Yeah, if you're willing to share it, that'd be great. Thank you. ",25:17
1651,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,83,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Um, how do you? How do you prioritize projects? How do you decide what can be done? What kind of  grants you want to go after? ",25:26
1647,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,83,1,Interviewee ,"A little mix and match. I've been doing this so long. There's grants that come up the same time every year.  So it's to the point now where I'm just repeating the grant. Homeland Security grant. You know, every  December, January, its Homeland Security grant time. Hey police and fire. What do you guys want?  Equipment, training. Okay. Let's put a homeland. A always put a Homeland Security grant together. You  know, that's where I was [REDACTED]. You know, build rapport, check the granters, new cyber grant  monies coming out. So I'm already telling the IT guy, Hey, get ready for cybersecurity, training, equipment,  whatever. Let's get some cybersecurity going. Big focus now from the federal government. Since the you  know, [REDACTED]. So federal government down to state cybersecurity. There's X amount of grant money  that's just for cybersecurity. So sometimes it's a combination of both. What do we want? We know I know  what we need. You know, I always tell all the department heads make sure I know what you need. Yeah.  And I'm on the look out, grants come down. Hey, we try to mix and match. Yeah, occasionally. Somebody  might, you know, department head might find a grant. Hey, [REDACTED], what about this? You know, I'd  love to get some body cameras for the police department. Hey, that's a body camera grant. Yeah, we can  do that. Yeah, let's go. How many you want? Yeah, let's put it together. ",25:34
1652,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,83,1,Interviewer 2 ,"You mentioned training for [REDACTED] things, is there ever anything about training on the water side,  the sewer side?

1648,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,83,1,Interviewee ,The state has the regular like their six courses. You guys know about those? There's six courses. I think  that they regularly. RUBA. ,27:19

[REDACTED] said if I got you another person, what would you do? I said, Well, I'd write the grants.  Because the tedious easier part is administering the money. What do you spend? Okay, do the report. ",27:35
1734,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,93,1,Interviewee ,Somebody else could do the report. I'd just seek new money. That's what I would do. If we were gonna  grow our operation. ,27:35

1656,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,84,1,Interviewee ,"No, no. State of Alaska. Only state of Alaska. It's a really detailed. Somebody put a lot of work into this  thing. It is pretty simple. Once you understand it, it does make sense. And it's really good. I kind of like it.  It's got a financial piece, a management piece, you know, practical, functional piece. And you've got to  score 60 points or more. Every twice a year it comes out so it's twice a year. They're collecting data on us,  and we're supposed to be doing these things and they're evaluated on this chart. We need 60 points to  maintain our grants, loans, any kind of water and sewer. And two of them are make or break questions.  Payroll liability, must have two points or more you got to have you know, you can't owe the federal  government any money. Payroll liability and workman's comp. But just looking at that score system. You  guys should look at that. That's a great way to evaluate water and sewer systems from every village. Yeah,  I think it's only villages and [REDACTED]. Yeah, I don't think [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]  don't play that game. Yeah, I think it's a way to evaluate villages and [REDACTED] is in that category. ",27:58

1735,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,93,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. I love that turns me on the most. This is kind of the boring part. Once you get the grant money. It's  exciting for kind of. But then you have to go administer it. [REDACTED] gotta go carry it out. I've gotta do  requests for bid. Get a copy of the check. Fill out the report. Not as exciting as the dream. Let me sell them  the dream. [REDACTED] We'll get piped water, the cost's gonna go down, hygiene is gonna be better, less  COVID. All this great stuff from running water. ",28:05
1738,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,93,1,Interviewer 1 ,"My last question. And then we'll let you have your Sunday back is how much communication do you do  with the public? Do you? I mean, from your position, is it like, you collect the surveys, but do you then  like, share the money like is it fairly quiet? ",28:43

Hey, [REDACTED], I just want to let everybody know, everybody know. That, you know, we're  working on the [REDACTED] or this or that or we're taking feedback. We're having this meeting  [REDACTED]. And for the [REDACTED], the engineers held meetings here live one by one with COVID. So  masked up and everything we had everybody come over and sign agreements, talk to him answer  questions, he had a slideshow. So we did have some public outreach as needed. I don't want the public  involved, unless I need the public involved. It's too much trouble, I've got enough to do on my own. I'm  working with people. I mean, I'd rather call [REDACTED] or call people that I need to work with.  [REDACTED]. I know what we need. And I talk to the public you know, and you stop me in the grocery  store, man.

1667,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,85,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So in terms of expanding the pipe system throughout the community, are you going to have to  demonstrate that people want that? Like, how do you show? No? Just that there's ability to pay for it?  [REDACTED] Like in the pipe water, you don't need to show that? ",30:03
1664,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,85,1,Interviewee ,"Right, right. There was an ordinance that said, when we come to your neighborhood with a mainline you  have to hook up. So it's kind of understood that we are piping the whole town. As fast as we can, as slow  as we can. We're trying to pipe the whole town. It's a money saver. And because of we got rid of honey  buckets, you know, we're requiring you to hook up to a sewer. Drink our water. We produce safe water.  We've got certified people. We've got three wells, running two plants. We're doing everything we can to  get you safe water. If you have your own well, or you want to buy water from the city and haul it yourself.  Fine. You can do that. Let us know. But it's required that you have hauled services. That you hook up. I  mean, your sewer tank has to be 200 gallons bigger than your water tank. A little extra room there. And  we're trying to provide you pipe water. So when we come by, hook up. So yeah, we have great cooperation  from the [REDACTED]. I really thought people were gonna resist just because they didn't want the ugly  pipes in their yard. They didn't. We got 100% cooperation. And we'll sign off on easements. Yes, you can  come on my property. We got money. I mean, USDA, not just, we're going to bring it to your main line.  Hook up to your house. We're gonna hook up to your house. That's a $40,000 cost. You know, each of the  [REDACTED]. Our grant loan is going to hook up to your house. And then turn it on. And your price goes  down. As soon as you're on piped, you start saving money. Unlimited and save money.  ",30:20
1668,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,85,1,Interviewer 1 ,So the grant for that included hookups for individual houses along the way. ,31:55
1665,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,85,1,Interviewee ,"Yep. Only residences. No commercial. That's USDA. Only residences. But the good thing is, it's not just  owner. It's also it's households. You know, one landlord owns five houses on the property. Each house  gets hooked up. Ultimately, the landlord benefits five times. ",32:00
1669,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,85,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah that's huge. For the commercial properties, so I know along the [REDACTED], those are metered,  right? So like, the [REDACTED] is metered? ",32:26
1666,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 5 ,85,1,Interviewee ,"There's like [REDACTED] metered commercial places in town. Yeah. All the commercial ones are metered.  And they have a certain rate for metered. We also sell water to the reseller [REDACTED]. And he resells it.  He cleans it, puts it through an osmosis system or whatever. So there's a lot of people [REDACTED] But  somebody thought we need to take all the minerals out. Everything out. Just liquid stuff. I'm using a Brita.  A lot of people in town use some filter water.  ",32:37

1740,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,94,2,Interviewee ,"Yeah, [REDACTED], So yeah, now just this past year, I put my hat into to run for [REDACTED] and now  going in there. So yeah, I guess just in terms of background of just kind of media, that sort of thing. That's  always kind of been my trajectory, media politics. Like that. ",00:14
1743,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,94,2,Interviewer 1 ,"So yeah, that's awesome. That's super cool. So we're gonna talk a little bit about just kind of how you use  water and your experiences with water. And then we can kind of go a little bit broader, and talk about  community. But so how do you get water at your home here in [REDACTED]? And how do you use that  water? ",01:25
1741,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,94,2,Interviewee ,"So right now I get water on the pipe system. I live here in [REDACTED]. So the pipe water I use that for like  doing dishes and showering and all that stuff. As for like drinking water, I get that from [REDACTED]. That's  like the place here in town. So in the apartment complex I lived in I used to get drinking water downstairs  because we had like a filter system and everything but we don't have that setup upstairs. So that's really  the only reason why I use the [REDACTED] place. ",01:42
1745,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,94,2,Interviewer 2 ,"Just as background [REDACTED]. My understanding is [REDACTED], like the source water is city water and  they run it through like an RO, like a reverse osmosis, so it is just in what why do you use that for drinking  water? ",02:14
1750,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,95,1,Interviewer 2 ,"So if [REDACTED] was going to move to [REDACTED], and she asked you, where she should live, like, is  piped water a consideration? ",05:58
1747,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,95,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I think so. But I mean, I don't really think that the hauled water is terrible. I mean, there is the price  aspect of it. And of course, we're running out. So I honestly probably wouldn't even like make it about  what kind of water because it's more about like the location. ",06:08
1751,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,95,1,Interviewer 2 ,"So if you had to pick piped or hauled, you'd pick piped? That would be your preference, having done it  both ways? ",06:27
1748,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,95,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. But it's kind of I mean, like, I would rather live in [REDACTED] because I like that subdivision. ",06:33
1752,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,95,1,Interviewer 2 ,So it's not like the most important thing.  ,06:38
1749,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,95,1,Interviewee ,Yeah.  ,06:42
1753,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,95,1,Interviewer 2 ,"But if you could, if you pick the house, and it like, if you could snap your fingers, and it would be piped,  you would want it to be.  ",06:43
1754,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,96,1,Interviewee ,"Definitely, definitely.  ",06:50
1758,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,96,1,Interviewer 2 ,"I've done it both ways, too. And the big thing for me, like listen to your topic, and it made me think of  having kids. And even having a pet was like when it was just me and I was living alone living on hot water  was fine, because I knew exactly how much water I used. And you know, like you just do laundry the day  before delivery, whatever. But then, like, I got a dog and then I had kids and then it was like all that's out  the window. You know, somebody throws up in the middle of the night. And it's like you're doing laundry  for the next three hours.  ",06:53
1755,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,96,1,Interviewee ,"There was that reminds me there was a few times because my dad has like a flatbed truck. And he has  like a water tank. So we would have our own water sometimes too. But that wasn't really, I forget why  but for some reason or another, we couldn't always do that. But that kind of like solved that problem. At  least like, like the tank wasn't super large. So it's like you have this much to like, pull yourself over. So  yeah.  ",07:30
1759,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,96,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Do you think that in general, most people in the public would prefer pipes? I mean, would they feel the  same as you or do you feel like it's a split or? ",07:58
1756,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,96,1,Interviewee ,"Well, I mean, yesterday hearing that people have problem with hauled water. That was kind of surprising  to me. Granted, I understand it, you know, I never really took into consideration maybe somebody has a  tank that's like, kind of gross or something. So um, yeah, I don't know. I actually I don't know. I do know  that like having unlimited water is awesome. And so I kind of feel like the pros of that kind of outweigh  the cons but yeah, I feel like now I have no idea. I thought maybe before I had a good idea. ",08:09
1760,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,96,1,Interviewer 2 ,"We've heard a mix of things. It seems like in general. I mean, it's not it's not a secret, right? People are  generally pro pipes in [REDACTED]. They like pipes and like the idea of unlimited water. There were some  people that like having a tank because then they can be in control of their tank and know. There are some  people that don't like the pipes because they think they're ugly, right? I don't want pipes running through  my backyard. And I don't want to fight with the city if something breaks that sort of thing. But it seems  like I mean, it's probably 80% of people they could snap their fingers and be on pipes. Maybe more than  that would do it in a heartbeat. And it seems like a lot of people also feel that whatever side they're on,  the other side is getting a better deal. They're sure they're getting ripped off. ",08:43
1757,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,96,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I mean, there's pros and cons to both I guess I just really feel like the biggest issue that I have with  pipe water is just what I mentioned with the city. I don't know that this seems like a really an annoying  problem. It just kind of feels like really dysfunctional. I don't know. ",09:37
1764,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,97,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. Can you talk more about that just kind of the relationship with the city as far as like, when something  breaks their responsiveness or even I know, like on the hauled side, there aren't enough water truck  drivers. So how does that experience kind of happen? ",09:58
1761,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,97,1,Interviewee ,"Um, so I can't say that I've personally dealt with it with the city myself a lot, because like, I lived with my  parents or the landlord dealt with it. But I can say the perception that I've or like, what I kind of hear from  folks around me is very negative, very unresponsive, or almost kind of like in the situation with my own  landlord, or where I'm living right now it kind of feels like there's like, ""Oh, that's not our job, you know,  like that's on you."" And that's just not really that my landlords really don't appreciate like that kind of like,  relationship. And then also, like speaking with repair people with like, come to my apartment, like, they  feel like the city kind of like just lets things sit around a lot, or like somebody told me like, “[REDACTED]  should be getting the city to do stuff, like or public works to do stuff"" or something like that. So I haven't  really I obviously have like an insider perspective on things. And I know, it's a little bit more like  complicated than that. I don't think the city is like, acting like that. [REDACTED]. And you know, like, I hear  these internal communications and things like that. But I can tell you public perception is just that the city  seems to be kind of, yeah, combative, and just like not doing anything. ",10:14
1765,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,97,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Do you have a sense of why that is? Do you think does it seem like it's like a, you know, your typical like,  community members are always gonna have something to complain about? Or does it seem like maybe  there are delays?  ",11:35
1762,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,97,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I think it's there's, there's certain constraints that the city's under, and people don't see that. And  rather than like, maybe thinking about that, people just jump to conclusions that like, you know, they're  slacking off or something like that. So. ",11:47
1766,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,97,1,Interviewer 2 ,"I guess we've been looking at from the council side and the city side. Are there we've heard a little bit  from like [REDACTED] about plans to develop more infrastructure and how like, prices have increased in  a way that's making it very difficult. But I also saw, I guess, pipes are getting replaced [REDACTED]. Sounds  like, is there? Can you talk a little bit about challenges and barriers from the city side? It seems like most  people want pipes. How come most people don't have pipes? How come we not have more pipes than  we do? ",12:12
1763,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,97,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, just cost. That's what I would chalk it up to. I mean, I have to admit, I'm not super knowledgeable  about this. This is not really my like area of expertise when it comes to like, infrastructure here in  [REDACTED]. But yeah, just seems like the cost has always been a barrier to that. And like they mentioned  yesterday, just how it's been like ballooning almost. But I also kind of feel like maybe there's some issue  with like, like property owners, or something like that. And yeah, I'm kind of cautious to talk about it too  much, because I don't really feel like super, super knowledgeable about that. So does that answer? ",12:54
1772,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,98,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Well, yeah. And I was thinking also about, like, prioritization. Right. So, you know, there was the  [REDACTED] project that will put new houses on pipes, but then there's, you know, obviously, old pipes  that need to get replaced. So how do you? How does the city you know, [REDACTED], like, how do you  decide which projects to move forward on and prioritize the money that you do have? ",13:43
1767,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,98,1,Interviewee ,"I think kind of what I've collected is just where it seems like people are getting like bad service. Like, we've  heard a lot of complaints of like water, you can't drink it, despite the fact that we say it's safe. I feel like  that certainly gets a lot of priority. But it's kind of weird, because like Council seems to want to make  improvements to it. But then, like, administration will tell us like, Oh, we don't we don't need to make this  change. It's fine, you know, but water like people still have to run faucets, to make sure their water comes  out clean and things like that. So yeah, I think just sort of like the public places that have like that. The  public perception is really poor. I think that's definitely where it gets the most. ",14:10
1773,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,98,1,Interviewer 2 ,Like the squeaky wheel gets the grease? ,14:57
1768,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,98,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah and so you know, because I don't think there's like a lot of issues necessarily with hauled. That  doesn't always like get priority, if that makes sense. ",14:59
1774,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,98,1,Interviewer 2 ,"To like, because it's even if it's not the best it's working. I mean, it's like, simple? ",15:13
1769,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,98,1,Interviewee ,"Right, yeah. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. ",15:19
1771,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,98,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Um, I want to ask, I don't know if this is something that you can speak to or not. So I'll ask, but um, I  wanted to ask a little bit about workforce challenges, because I know, the city side of things, they, they  need more water truck drivers, they need more operators, I'm sure they need, you know, more of  everyone. And I just wasn't sure if you had a sense of, of maybe why they're struggling to get folks to  work. ",15:27
1770,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,98,1,Interviewee ,"I know, one of the big things that comes up a lot is like the licensing that's required to operate some of  these trucks and sort of the challenge of, you know, hiring people, but also getting them trained. I don't  think we have the capacity to train people out here. I mean, we have like the [REDACTED] and all that  stuff. But if I remember correctly, there was like a certification, you could get there for a period of time  and then like the state took it away, or something to that effect. So I know that's a big barrier. Is not having  the ability to train people out here. ",15:50
1776,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,99,1,Interviewer 1 ,"This might be a little bit of a naive question, but this was just it was a conversation between me and  [REDACTED] earlier, someone else told us that they were able to get their CDL through [REDACTED] that's  like the vocational training?. Because when I said [REDACTED], she thought [REDACTED] and I was like, no  I don't think so. ",16:27
1783,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,99,1,Interviewer 3 ,"Yeah, that's confusing.  ",16:43
1777,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,99,1,Interviewer 1 ,Those are two separate things both called [REDACTED].  ,16:45
1780,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,99,1,Interviewer 2 ,[REDACTED] ,16:46
1778,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,99,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Okay. That is helpful. We've heard a little bit about, I guess, there. At one point, there was a waiver that  folks were able to get CDLs that were like, off highway? ",17:39
1781,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,99,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah, like off road? Yeah. ",17:54
1779,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,99,1,Interviewer 1 ,"It sounds like maybe that has been taken away. So that it's interesting and helpful to hear a little more  about a bigger thing. What else, [REDACTED]? What am I missing? ",17:58
1782,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,99,1,Interviewer 2 ,"I mean, I'm, it's probably premature to ask this question. But I'm super curious about the regional stuff.  Right? Do you have thoughts about water infrastructure in the region? What can you tell us about that?  And I think like, it may be too early. ",18:12
1775,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,99,1,Interviewee ,"Well, I just I'll preface this by saying like, I might say something now only to learn like a lot more later on.  It's certainly a priority of [REDACTED], improving infrastructure in our region. I think in [REDACTED], it's  certainly been like a priority of mine. And that kind of stems from like a lot of what I learned. I don't know  if you're around, we just recently had like a pretty angry debate about taxing sugary, sweetened beverages  here in [REDACTED]. And the big push up against it was that people cannot drink the water here. So like  for me going into something like that. It was like I thought, you know, if we added a tax to it, that would  incentivize people to drink water instead, and then they came back and were like, we can't drink the water  here. Like it's not safe to drink. And so coming from that, like improving drinkable water, like in our region,  and of course in our community has, like become really important to me to the point at which I almost  wanted to start like, a nonprofit just for getting people water because I don't know I just think it's really  concerning that like a predominantly Native Alaskan community is forced to drink like, like sugary ",18:34
1784,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,100,1,Interviewee ,"sweetened beverages that are like really bad for you. And that feels very predatory to me. So, yeah, that's,  that's certainly one of the key things that I hope to try and improve as [REDACTED]. So does that answer? ",18:34
1787,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,100,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah. Have you had? I mean, we so we went to [REDACTED]. And I mean, it was interesting to kind of  compare and contrast. And, you know, there's just so much diversity. And, you know, I don't, I don't know  that I have the same sense. You know, like I was saying, like, most people here would want pipes. And I  think we heard that in [REDACTED] as well. But like the amount of trust people have in the water system,  the value that they would place or how they prioritize pipe water? I don't have a good sense of that for  other communities. [REDACTED] like, some of it was what I expected. Some of it wasn't, you know, I mean,  and I don't even know, [REDACTED] next door, do they feel the same? That sort of thing? And so? Yeah, I  mean, I guess like, I'm curious about that. If I was in your situation. Water is important. Infrastructure is  important. I don't know that I would know what that actually like, specifically, what that means? Does  that mean, more water plant operator training? Does that mean more pipes? Or does that mean, more  testing of the water? Like the aesthetic issues? That comes up a lot. That seems to be a barrier for people  drinking water. Is the smell, look, taste, right? So it's not bad for you to drink water with iron in it, but  people sure don't like it, you know? And so if it becomes a factor if people will opt for Coke, or Kool Aid  instead, you know, tang instead? So it's, you know? Yeah, so I don't know, I was thinking about that. And  I don't know if you thought about it at all, or have a better sense of what that would look like. ",20:19
1785,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,100,1,Interviewee ,"Well, I mean, the fact that there's communities that don't even have running water in the first place. It's  incredibly alarming. I don't know if that's a priority for people or not. But yeah, I just, I think just having  access to clean drinking water, the bare minimum, like I think is important. And I don't know how you ask  somebody to drink something that doesn't seem safe to them. So I'm sorry, I don't think that really  answered your question. ",22:05
1788,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,100,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Doesn't matter. Yeah. But that's a good, that is a good, like, insight. I mean, because some of that has to  do with how people feel about it. Right. So you could have the same water in two different communities.  People felt like it was safe, or they didn't feel like it was safe. I mean, that social aspect, like might have  something to do with changing people's, like beliefs more than changing water. Right? Like, I mean, you  see, I'm saying like, you could have the same water in two different places. And one group of people could  say, No, we don't feel comfortable drinking this and other group could. So the only difference is how  people feel. So that's like, a different angle on, you know, certainly like [REDACTED], you know, historic  thing with fluoride and, you know, sort of bad feelings about still have, you know, pretty cautious about  that stuff now, understandably so, public perceptions, and I don't know, I guess maybe that's another  angle is like, how do you? or do you, you know, like, Is that another way to kind of address the problem is  through education? ",22:39
1786,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,100,1,Interviewer 1 ,"And I think, I think that's all really helpful, because that's a little bit of what I was going to ask as well.  Certainly, there are communities out here, their water service, they don't have it or it's not adequate. It  doesn't, maybe some communities, they're not getting that water, but I am curious on your sense of, you ",23:53
1792,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewer 1 ,"know, how much of the community is or what could be done to help people understand if their water is  drinkable? Or how do we work with people to help figure out what drinkable means to them? Yeah, and  match that up with what is drinkable to, you know, EPA and other things.  ",23:53
1794,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewer 2 ,"That's a good point like if you don't feel comfortable with this water, what would make you feel Yeah, I  don't I don't know the answer to that either. So that's really interesting dimension. ",24:38
1789,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewee ,"I mean, I always immediately think of like what, [REDACTED] I would really be interested to see like how  like [REDACTED] might help with like the facilitating some of that and like finding out what people's  thoughts are but also like providing like education and things like that you know, I think they were really  instrumental in trying that tax that I mentioned they were diabetes department really tried to get that  passed and maybe we eventually tabled that, that ordinance. And so maybe like their diabetes program  could take on, you know, finding out how do you get people to drink water as opposed to you know,  sugary sweetened beverages? ",24:51
1795,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewer 2 ,"I mean, there's canned water too, right? ",25:46
1790,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewee ,Canned water?  ,25:48
1796,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewer 2 ,Like sparkling water. That's what I drink.  ,25:50
1791,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, gotcha. I don't know. I don't associate I drink like both but like, I don't I don't feel hydrated drinking  like sparkling water. I don't know. Is it the same? Like hydration wise? ",25:53
1797,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah, yeah. And there was, um, I don't know, I'm just based on what I read on the internet. There was  some initial concern about like the carbonation like being, like not good for your teeth or your bones or  something. But apparently that got debunked. So it's like, it's actually like, a health benefit is that people  tend to drink more if it's like, tasty and fun to drink. So people stay like, hydrated a little bit better. ",26:07
1793,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewer 1 ,[REDACTED] ,26:34
1798,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,101,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Because our whole family switched, we drink a ton, like I've got a big CO2 tank. So I like I looked into it a  little bit because the kids drink a lot of it too. And it doesn't seem like it's associated with any health  problems. But there is. This will always get kicked back from water quality people is that the water is  regulated differently that goes into soft drinks and canned varieties. Right. So the water that comes out ",26:54
1804,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,102,1,Interviewer 2 ,"of our water treatment plant is like regulated as water and not as a food. And so there's more stringent  testing that happens on our water here than like Coca Cola. Because that's like through the FDA instead  of the, like the DEC or the EPA. Yeah. So that's kind of a rebuttal to, that I've heard multiple times is that  like you, like if you buy water off the shelf as a consumer product in a bottle, or you buy a Coke or  whatever. You don't actually know that you don't know what's in that water. Which is kind of interesting.  ",26:54
1801,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,102,1,Interviewer 1 ,"It's weird, because I even, like I know that. But I still will be like, in a new city. And I'm like, well, I'd rather  have a bottled water. But actually, I should know.  ",28:08
1805,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,102,1,Interviewer 2 ,"And most bottled waters are from municipal sources, right? It's like [REDACTED], where they just turn on  the tap, and then run it through a filter and then sell it back to you. Sometimes it's fancy and they add a  little bit of minerals or whatever. But I think like there's not a lot of cases where it's really out of the  ground, you know? Somebody had a waterfall.  ",28:18
1802,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,102,1,Interviewer 1 ,Do you have any more questions? Or is there anything that you want to talk about that we didn't ask you?  Something we should be asking? ,28:48
1799,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,102,1,Interviewee ,"Um, I mean, just yesterday after that, that presentation, I was just thinking about, like, I would I don't  know if this fits what you guys are working on or not, but I am really interested to see like how often  people are like, sort of driven to drink soda or something like that, as opposed to drinking water. Because  I think that has like a huge ripple effect. I really think that that's like a really negative thing that we have,  like in our region. Like, I just really feel like people are taken advantage of like and I think it has like yeah,  just like a lot of effects and so yeah, I wasn't sure if that really fit but yeah, just like learning like how often  people choose, deliberately choose like, oh, I don't want to drink water because it's like not safe. So I'm  gonna, you know, buy a soda or something like that, but it's definitely something that I might add to it. ",28:55
1806,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,102,1,Interviewer 2 ,So it's not something we've been asking. ,29:57
1800,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,102,1,Interviewee ,"I mean, does it fit because I feel like. ",29:59
1803,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,102,1,Interviewer 1 ,"it's certainly tangential, I think, absolutely. It's certainly relevant to our understanding. Our very specific  work looks more at infrastructure. But all of those things absolutely impact what we do. And so it's a little  bit of like, that is very public health focus. Right. And, and we're very infrastructure, but you can't have  one without the other. So I think it's, it's relevant.  ",30:02
1813,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,103,1,Interviewer 3 ,"Especially with end users, and that's something we can pretty easily integrate into the end-user. Yeah. As  we talk to people who use water every day, yeah. What do you usually drink is probably a good question  to integrate. Yeah. Well, it's like at the restaurant, we went to a restaurant with [REDACTED] two nights  ago. We all got root beer. We were like, we don't know about the tap water here. And we haven't been  drinking tap. We've been drinking like the [REDACTED] water straight out of the faucet. And so we're like,  we feel like root beer might be a safer option. But for day to day, like that kind of ",30:31
1810,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,103,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah. No, I think it is. I mean, because we've been asking, Where do you get the water that you drink?  Loading the question, right? Rainwater or they say, tap water, or they say bottled water, or they say, tea  or coffee. This is where I get the water for that. But I think asking about, you know, where do you get the  liquids? It might be a little more. I guess it's I mean, it's a little bit hard for me to think that there's a lot of  people that if you really pin them down, that they honest to god believe Coca Cola was healthier for them  than other options they had available. Like I would be challenged to, like, believe that I would see it on  the margins more as skewing people towards like, when they're, you know, like, Oh, that one, but I don't  mean, man, like there's just so like, pop is just so you know, like, I think I think we pounded that message  home, haven't we? Did you look at the menu and say root beer is the healthiest option? Yeah. Exactly.  Like there was probably LaCroix or something. I think on the margins, it might push a consumer a certain  direction. But I think it would be I don't think there'd be a lot of people that would make the argument  that like, my healthiest option for hydration is root beer. ",30:42
1808,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 6 ,103,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I think there's also, at least in my head healthy and safe are two different things, right. And so if I was  someone who didn't think my water was safe, I wouldn't necessarily say root beer is healthier than water.  But I might say at the moment, this is safer.  ",32:24

If I drink anything else, I just feel terrible. And so when I think about that  on a mass scale, maybe I'm projecting my personal experience too much. But like a lot of people drink  soda.

So kind of anecdotally, but I just feel like I know so many  people that, that haven't gotten justice for their situations. And it was just because like, maybe their case  wasn't investigated, or we just had a big thing where somebody their kit sat at the hospital for for more  than 30 days, and that's actually illegal.

Don't want to take that. Don't want to take that risk. So. But yeah, like  we used to have a faucet that would like filtered it all. And so if I had something like that, I would use it. I  just don't have that set up in my current apartment. So I don't know if this is useful or not. But prior to  that, like growing up, I used to live on hauled water. Do you want me to talk about that at all? So when I  grew up, I lived on hauled water. And then I for a period of time I like bought my own. Or like when I had  my own apartment up in [REDACTED], we had a hauled water as well. And so I didn't have any problems  with it growing up in terms of like drinking it and using it, we had a filtration system in my house. So I  would just use it all the time. The only downside would be like at certain points of the month, you know,  if we maybe had guests staying at our house or something like that, we'd have to like conserve water. Like  I remember my parents used to keep like a little float in their water tank to kind of see where it was going.  And if it went past a certain point then we'd have to kind of ration water out. Or then so you run out of ","I just don't really feel comfortable drinking it straight from the tap without some sort of filtration. Yeah, it "

So the only really gripe that I had about it, especially when I was  living by myself not having the income to be able to like get like the same service. Like I went from like  growing up with a water truck coming every week to maybe like once a month, running out of water just  really that really sucked like because it like renting a property as opposed to like living there and knowing  the homeowners like you didn't really know when the water was gonna run out and like when you're, you  know, getting up in the morning to take a shower and like it's not working. It's just a terrible feeling. So  and yeah, I think when I was living in the apartment, too, I didn't drink the water. I guess I've just never I  really never want to take it from the source. Like I need to have that filtered. So yeah, I'm sorry to kind of  backtrack now but, in terms of like piped water, the issue that we've had, and this might just be the  location of the apartment building I live in. In the wintertime, it'll like freeze up. And then we can't really  use water or if we do, like it won't drain. So we've had to use like a pump to get water out of our tub or  like just like use a bucket and then flush it. And my landlords were kind of like, fighting with the city over  who was supposed to pay for fixing the whole thing and kind of resulted in like a bunch of sewer water  getting like blasted under our house and frozen. So that wasn't awesome. But that aside, I think having  like piped water is always like an ideal thing in [REDACTED], at least from what I've seen, because you  have unlimited water. And that's, that's awesome.  ","I just don't really feel comfortable drinking it straight from the tap without some sort of filtration. Yeah, it "

1826,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,105,2,Interviewer 3 ,And your background a little bit.  ,01:51
1821,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,105,2,Interviewee ,"Okay. So what I'm told is they would normally have five operators here on five operators, not in this plant,  but on staff. They're currently down to one when they had two and then they got word that one was  leaving, they reached out. We were put in touch with them through [REDACTED] who does a lot of work.  They're an engineering term contractor. So they contacted us about a month before [REDACTED] left here  who was working here. And then when, before he left, we came out and did some kind of handoff. We  came out for a couple of four-day shifts. [REDACTED]. And then [REDACTED], who works with me, or  opposite me typically, on joint ventures like this. [REDACTED] but we're all licensed. We have all the  insurance. [REDACTED]. So we're out here until they can get additional staff hired. And I don't know. Yeah,  it's open ended right now. [REDACTED]. So this is a recurring problem around the state, lack of operators  or lack of experienced higher licensed operators. So it's not just here. It's everywhere. [REDACTED]. I was  started out in maintenance and I went into treatment. [REDACTED]. So his background is more towards  wastewater, mine's more towards water. So between the two of us, we cover pretty much everything. He  just went home yesterday; I flew out last night. And then I'll go home on Thursday and he'll come back.  We talked to [REDACTED] right in the gap while he left and yeah, We normally see each other. Well, we  generally see each other at the airport when I leave. He flies out of here early on Thursday so he can drive  home to [REDACTED] before dark. But so that's it.  ",01:53

So work closely with trying to develop techniques and approaches to get operators certified  and send them to get them certified and make sure that the subject and the classes that are being taught  are helping operators pass the licenses.

1825,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,105,2,Interviewer 2 ,"That's a huge that's exactly that's what we're studying. Yeah, we were like, when we started talking, I was  like, whoa, okay, we need to bring back the crew because ",05:06
1827,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,106,1,Interviewee ,[REDACTED]. Cool. So pretty well connected with most of the different things. And that's it I'll answer any  questions you got about whatever. Yeah. You guys are all doing this college study or what do you do? ,05:16

But I do know he's  doing great things, and having really good results, getting the local operators out here in this area and  other areas, remote areas of the state, to at least pass a small water system or the small untreated system.  I know that he's doing a very good job remotely teaching classes. So ",06:16
1834,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,106,1,Interviewer 1 ,He was out here for a bunch of years. And so I think the insight into it that sometimes nothing personal  but [REDACTED] ,06:41
1830,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,106,1,Interviewee ,"You're not going to hurt my feelings. It's a different realm in there, totally. and the quicker everybody  realizes that the better off the state will be because there's a huge shortage of operators. And what we  do and the way we operated there doesn't necessarily apply out here. It's totally different. ",06:49
1835,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,106,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So I am sure everyone has a million questions. Once upon a time the state made its own rules about water  plant operators, right? Then we went to federal standards and lot of people, at least from what I've heard  out here felt like that was not. ",07:13
1831,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,106,1,Interviewee ,"So what we do is a number of years ago, we went into the ABC system, right in was the American Board  of certifications or something like that. Yeah. So we had to get come up with a standardized test that was  basically applicable nationwide. And in the past, the tests were much more suited towards or developed  towards our uniqueness or our you know, what we do up here and how things are done, ",07:30
1837,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,106,1,Interviewer 2 ,Was it initially state based then it became federally? ,07:53
1838,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,107,1,Interviewee ,"Right, And some of that was done so that our operators and other operators can enjoy reciprocity. So if  you like certain states, we recognize for reciprocity, and then we recognize them back both ways. So I  have reciprocity down to [REDACTED]. And I want to say it's back in [REDACTED], they were looking at one  of the companies [REDACTED], it didn't work out. But so I mean, that that was supposed to be a good  thing is to go through ABC, and someone had standardized testing. And it didn't leave everything on us to  come up with our own tests and our own specific questions, but we lost uniqueness that would apply  directly to us. But we do get stateside operators commonly applying for jobs up here and then asking for  reciprocity. And the nice thing is, is if they've taken an ABC exam we recognize it in general, there are  certain states we don't because part of it is they don't recognize us. So ",07:56
1842,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,107,1,Interviewer 2 ,"so how I mean how given that it's federally now, like regulated, and the systems up here are pretty  different. I mean, certainly, we've just spent time in [REDACTED]. And so like that super small system is  very different. ",09:03
1839,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,107,1,Interviewee ,"right, you get out into smaller communities. They're very different in that regard, right? I mean, they're  fill and draw systems, many of them they fill all winter long or out of the ice or all summer long out of the  river and then they try and keep it going for them. Whereas other people are pumping groundwater  pumping surface water or combination of both. ",09:14
1843,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,107,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Do you feel like this kind of size system. Do you feel like that certification is I mean, does it prep them for  what they need to know to run this kind of plant? ",09:36
1840,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,107,1,Interviewee ,"It's 100% applicable right here. This to me is a plant you would see at any midsize community. I'll use it  Alaska term. I mean, this is a really normal plant. This is the same. In essence it's the same plant  [REDACTED] was running out in [REDACTED].  ",09:43
1844,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,107,1,Interviewer 2 ,"so rural lower states maybe like in a rural area below, it's similar systems. ",10:06
1841,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,107,1,Interviewee ,"When you get out into the smaller communities around here where they're more just filling it, chlorinating  it, maybe they got a small package filtration system, I get that. But this is a, it's a pretty nice little plant  and you got a backup plant over here. It's got redundancies in it. The lab, I mean, okay. And to me the  tests that the ABC level one or level two, very applicable to this. But then again, I'm used to a much bigger  system that I've tested at much higher levels.  ",10:10
1847,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,108,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So that's kind of some of the like, I'm not a water plant operator. But some of the ideas or feedback that  we've heard is that you know, that it is designed around reciprocity and being able to go other places and  we're dealing in the village with water plant operators who have lived in [REDACTED] their entire life,  they're not going to go work in [REDACTED]. ",10:42
1845,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,108,1,Interviewee ,"And that's perfect. We talked about that a little bit, because let's get those operators certified because  they have a vested interest, and I call them growing your own, they're not gonna leave. Because right now  the big problem is, you get an operator certified if they have no vested interest or no home roots here,  they will work anywhere because of reciprocity, right? I mean, why do I want to stay here, if I can go make  the same or better money and a cheaper place to live with more of the things that make life enjoyable,  and it's very mobile now state of Alaska PER system, up here used to be a defined benefit. When you when  you retired, you got a defined benefit. Now, it's not it's a 401K program, so you're very mobile with your  retirement. So there's no real vested or no real interest to stay here a reason to stay here, the older  employees that are like I'm halfway in, there's no reason to leave. Now I've got a 30 year out program,  and I get Lifetime Medical and get a defined benefit program. Well, now the Lifetime Medical is gone. It's  no longer defined benefit. So your 401K is so mobile, there's no reason to stay necessarily working in a  PERS or a state PERS job, which many of these communities are. ",11:05
1848,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,108,1,Interviewer 1 ,"What do you think about like, how would it because trying to get people through the test is seems to be  a challenge. ",12:23
1846,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,108,1,Interviewee ,"So what really comes down to me is, and I'll say this right away, just go take the test, sign up, go take it.  the community should pay them to go take it right away. And know going in, you're doing it to learn what  you don't know or what you need to know. Yeah baseline, exactly. There are, we need to also teach how  to take the test. Okay, four answers to every question. It's multiple guess, right? If you can throw two of  them out there, you get 50%, a lot of that comes down to looking at the test and realizing how to take it,  right. If you can eliminate a couple now you have 50%, you need 70% to pass, typically 100 questions. And  then at the end of that you get a report back saying, these are the aspects safety management, chemistry,  math, and they'll give you a breakdown of how you did in each one. Now you can go out, figure out what  you need to learn. For many of them, it's just instead of. Many people I speak with have said I took the  test I didn't do well, I don't want to take it again. It's a fear of failure. But it's like why? It's, you know, first  time I took a test, I got 68 It's frustrating, right, two questions. I know many people have come back with  a 68. Go take it again, you know, sign right back up. 30 days from now go take it again, when whatever  you study for if you've studied fresh in your mind, you only gotta get two more. You know, there's like, I  think there's three or four different tests that pop out, or there's, you know, there's, there's a small  grouping of tests. And many of the questions are asked the same on each test. And then there's different  variances, but just go take it again. ",12:29
1849,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,108,1,Interviewer 2 ,You were talking about some differences in math training and like problem solving techniques that make  some of that challenging. ,14:23
1850,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,109,1,Interviewee ,"Yep, that's where I'm going is, you know, find out what your weakness is. And then let's teach. Many times  you can look at a problem, look at the answers and go these are ballpark answers, right? I mean, math is  quickly coming up with doing pounds formula, and you quickly come up and say, oh, you know what, 22  or 24 pounds seems close. Throw those other two out and only work on these two and figure it out. And  that's where I'm going teaching them how to take a test right, recognizing questions and what would seem  to be correct based off your knowledge or your experience and being able to whittle it down and now  playing with 50% answered instead of 25. Teaching them to go through and answer all the questions that  they know off the front mark all the ones they don't know, and then come back. And if you've got 70  already done, you know that you're pretty sure you're right, those 30 that are left, let me do the best I  can, if I can get 50% out of those 30. Chances are good, I'm gonna get 85. Right? I mean, so that's where I  go, somewhat is teaching them how to take the test. The other thing is, is making sure they understand,  don't look at it as a failure. If you go in and take the test, if you don't pass. Nobody's critiquing whether  you passed or not. Maybe the maybe the person that paid for it is frustrated that they paid for it didn't  pass but every mistake is a learning opportunity, right? I mean, as long as you don't keep making the same  mistakes over and over again, you'll learn from it's a good thing. So I hear that over and over again, as I  passed, I don't want to take it again. It's like, No, you have to go take it again, you need to go take it again  and as soon as you take your one and get it, take your two, ""well I don't have the time"" I don't care. Take  your two while it's fresh in your mind. So many of the same questions are there. Now you've got your two  taken, and you've got all this time to get your experience. And then soon as you have your experience get  your two license. Don't wait and take the two. Take it right behind the one. Those are things that to me  makes it better. And we'd get a higher success or a passing rate. If we just did that. ",14:29
1852,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,109,1,Interviewer 3 ,So this shortage of operators do you think a lot of it is people cannot pass the test? Or do you think there  are things before and after that that are also issues? ,16:37
1851,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,109,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Okay. So in today's world, is water and sewer treatment, a glamorous position? Who wants to go  into it? My son is [REDACTED] years old, right? I mean, he knows what it's done for us as a family. But he's  not in a big hurry to go into water, wastewater, and I can get him right in the door. I mean, no problem.  How many of the kids or young people nowadays, young adults want to go into this field, even though  you can work anywhere in the world, every community's got it. And all you got to do is have a little bit of  mechanical instinct and a little bit of basic knowledge of whether it's chemistry or electrical or  instrumentation. If you can have the right thought process, it makes this career this, this field pretty,  pretty easy. But many of the younger people don't really look at this. I mean, they might consider being  electrician, they might consider being a carpenter because that's a job that just came their way. But to  really go out and go to a college or, or go, you don't need to go to college, even though there are colleges  out there that have programs, you can just go to the field. There's a mentoring program, everybody will  mentor. Young or inexperienced operators. I shouldn't say young. Inexperienced operators that want to  get into the field, I've yet to find any utility that's not willing to have a path in the door for them to come  in. You think it's a workforce thing where people aren't wanting to work or aren't interested in it? Yeah  just it's I don't know if it's not glamorous, it's not promoted that's, you know, lack of knowledge out there ",16:46
1853,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,110,1,Interviewee ,"that it's a field, it's, you know, understaffed and up here in Alaska. It's a great paying job. Different  communities have huge variances in their pay rates. And that's some of it why, why stay in [REDACTED]  when I go to [REDACTED]. And I can make [REDACTED] bucks an hour, right? And I can stay here and make  [REDACTED] and the cost of living is so much higher. Or I can go out to [REDACTED] and make [REDACTED]  bucks an hour, but now you got a [REDACTED] round trip to go back and forth. Right? I mean, but in  general state of Alaska, we have very good pay scale for this water wastewater industry. You go down to  the south, not nearly as good. [REDACTED] It's not as good. Because I know I was looking to move down  there years ago when I retired thinking I would go down there and get a non PERS job.  ",16:46

1988,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,125,1,Interviewer 2 ,Do you feel like that's trainable? Is that something that is a part of current training practices? ,1:00:39
1983,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,125,1,Interviewee ,"Yes, I think it needs to be promoted. For so many operators, their career is driven or their career is actually  kind of throttled or held back by the ability to pass a test and be certified. It doesn't necessarily make  them a good operator, but it probably gives them more pay. And it allows them to accept more  responsibility and allow the community or the municipality to be compliant with regulation. ",1:00:45
1989,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,125,1,Interviewer 2 ,"One of the reasons we got interested in it initially is because you can get a lot of federal funding to run  plants if you've got certified operators. And so that's a big barrier to finding money to run in rural areas. I  mean, that's initially a very long time ago, how we started down this path. ",1:01:17
1984,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,125,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, it's all true, but it doesn't necessarily make them a good operator. Yeah. I mean, how many  professors or whatever have you had that weren't good teachers? ",1:01:32
1990,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,125,1,Interviewer 2 ,Do you think it happens more that good operators aren't certified or that certified operators aren't good  operators? In Alaska. Or maybe that's not a fair question. ,1:01:42
1985,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,125,1,Interviewee ,"I would have to think about that. Because I mean, almost every operator I've worked with, was good at  something. I mean, they all had it's kind of like the toolbox analogy, you got your operators, and they're  all good at something, you just have to figure out what they're the best at, and then utilize them for that  aspect. But push them gently get them to work outside of their comfort zone. So they gain that other  experience. And that's part of management, or that's part of, you know, being that senior operator that  promotes that, because nobody wants to go outside their comfort zone and make a mistake. Like I said, a  mistake is a learning opportunity. Go out there and try that. And come back. Let's talk about what went  right or wrong. And then next time, it won't be like that. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to say either way,  that there's more. It's just, it's all part of just pushing them to go out and ask questions and think about  why they're doing what they're doing. And I'll tell you, that's another thing is a log book operator that just  writes down numbers, that doesn't even think about what they're writing down. They read it and they  never even thought about what it is, and how can they write down that the fluoride is 4.5 milligrams per  liter, and not even question. Is that right? Is that good or that bad? And you see that a lot. ",1:01:55

So I wrote it down. Well, didn't you question what you were writing down? drive  you crazy. I write the information down 14 times. Still doesn’t mean anything. Just books and books and  books.

1997,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,126,1,Interviewer 3 ,"I mean, that was one thing I was going to ask. That was good. Another one. You kind of touched a little bit  on the continuing education. And so one specific question I have is you're a level [REDACTED]. Right? But  how do you maintain that if you're not always working on a level [REDACTED]? ",1:03:54
1992,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,126,1,Interviewee ,"Once your licensed, every three years, you can either you can either take the test again, or you can take  CEUs. And if you get three CEUs in a three year period, two of which must be core to the subject or to the  to the field you're doing. One can be non core. You can renew your license by just paying. If I don't want  to take the CEUs. I can just retest. ",1:04:11
1995,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,126,1,Interviewer 2 ,What do you usually do? ,1:04:41
1993,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,126,1,Interviewee ,I take the CEUs. But at the same time I've been tested. I got my licenses as a non ABC license. Prior to the  ABC. ,1:04:42
1996,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,126,1,Interviewer 2 ,When did that all happen? ,1:04:56
1994,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,126,1,Interviewee ,"Don't recall, I'm gonna guess late 90s, maybe early 2000s. So when they came out with the ABC because  I wanted to enjoy reciprocity, or have the benefit of it. I went in and retested and got new licenses.  [REDACTED]. So I was just taking. I just took my CEUs last year to renew my licenses. And what's nice is it  sounds like a lot, right? Three CEUs, and it can be a pain in the butt to take, but at the same time, it covered  all four licenses. Yeah, so by taking three CEUs, it actually applied to three. I went to the AWWA website.  And they had a whole bunch of classes in there that were available for the small water system operators,  I took a number of them and then I took a couple other courses that were paid for. All remote, all done  sitting at home. The other option was I could have paid and went to a class or I could have went to a  seminar somewhere set in the classroom and got some CEUs. But I took them all remotely and they were  just put the old earbuds in and sit back and watch, you know, watch the computer and listen to it and  then take a test. ",1:05:00
1998,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,126,1,Interviewer 3 ,"And that's roughly 30 hours, right? Like one CEU is roughly 10 hours. ",1:06:44
1999,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,127,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. It sounds like it'll be a big loss. Are you like trying to bring people? It's supposed  to equate to 8 to 10 hours. And then I've done both, I've tested and I've taken CEUs. But the preference  now is take CEUs. In order to get a higher level wastewater license, I will have to retest because I'm only  level [REDACTED] in wastewater treatment. And that's just because I got into it late. I never was in  wastewater until I retired. Yeah. And when we went to [REDACTED], we were doing both. So that's where  I started. And then [REDACTED] started out we were only doing water when I first went under contract. It  was for water, but then come to find out they lost all their wastewater people. So we did both water and  wastewater out there. So I was able to accumulate enough experience and time to where I could sit for  [REDACTED], I don't know. [REDACTED].  ",1:06:48

2000,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,127,1,Interviewee ,"Just [REDACTED] and I right now, okay, but we've reached out to a number of people see they get bit by  ""Oh I'm retired."" So they can't go to work for a PERS job. Because if you work in a PERS job by that  employer, you lose your PERS benefits, your retirement benefit. So I can be a contractor to [REDACTED],  and I'm fine. But I couldn't go to work for [REDACTED]. So I couldn't be hired by it. So that's one of the  problems that's going on at this stage is when they retire when it happens. Or retiree. If they want to go  back to work, you've got to go in as a contractor somewhere else. So then you got all the rigmarole of  that. The other thing is. A few of them I've talked to said social security bites them. They go back to work.  They make too much money between their retirement benefits and that. ",1:07:56

One thing that's  been, I guess, kind of confusing to me over the years is how, how's the water plant like this able to get out  of compliance? Like shouldn't there be someone at DEC seeing all these logs? ",1:13:28

2024,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,129,1,Interviewer 1 ,So is somebody looking at these logs? Or like how do we get [REDACTED] behind on our testing? ,1:14:03
2020,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,129,1,Interviewee ,"Okay, so I don't really know. I don't know how that happens. But keep in mind that you typically,  everybody gets a sampling schedule, and you wouldn't know about it until they become delinquent and  you start filling out your annual monitoring report or something like that. And then your CCR comes out.  You know what CCR is? Yeah. Okay. Consumer Confidence Report. Yeah. Okay. So that comes out annually,  you're required to publish it. And that's generally when everything gets captured. ",1:14:10

2021,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,129,1,Interviewee ,"And that's part of it is, you probably look at the number of communities that are out there, the number  of reports or files that they get, and the ability for them to oversee all. And I don't know, I don't know that  side of it. Because when I see a sample, it's easy to go take the sample. It's easier than writing that letter  that I gotta pull up the CCR. Right, it's easier, just go take it, it's what you got to do to do it. I don't know  how you get in a situation where it goes from lack of compliance, lack of enforcement, to the point and if  you wanted to look at a case study, I mean, it's the thing in [REDACTED], Alaska, it's to where it got so bad  that the DEC or the EPA filed a federal lawsuit against them, to where they entered into a consent decree  and the federal court system took over, basically jurisdiction telling them what they would do for their  system. The system, they would build the timeframe to do it to achieve benchmarks, and then to be 100%  compliant for 20 consecutive quarters. Five years, five years, they cannot have a violation. How does it go  from that situation where you have a community that's thriving, that makes a lot of money in the fishing  industry, to where you're non-compliant? And then the federal government actually steps in and issues a  consent decree. How does that happen? I don't know. ",1:15:51
2030,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,130,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I mean, it feels a little bit like communities that are on their own, do a good job making you feel like there's  a lot of oversight, ",1:17:28
2026,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,130,1,Interviewee ,"You would certainly hope that they're all out to do the right thing and to provide safe drinking water and  be stewards of the environment with their wastewater treatment. You would hope that I mean, it's, it's  not that hard to do it right. And I think most of them probably are doing the best they can. But they may  not be doing the monitoring. And sometimes, I'll say another thing you have to remember here is, every  sample you take has a hold period. So certain samples have shorter hold periods. I pull them today, and  the flight doesn't get in. Yeah, so sometimes it comes down to the ability to get a sample in a timely  manner to a lab. Sometimes it comes down to bad planning, where I'm going to do my quarterly samples  in the last week. And guess what happened that week, I got sick, or the planes couldn't get in, right. Instead  of taking them at the beginning of the quarter, or the middle of the quarter to where you had time to  recover. Or you take them on Friday, and you ship them off and the lab writes you back on Monday, the  first day of the next quarter and says, Hey, we had a temp blank that didn't come in. Your samples are no  good. Right. So that could that could get you on the SNIC. List. Okay, significant noncompliance. You could  end up on that, you know, that list of non-compliant communities, even though you've done everything  right. ",1:17:35
2031,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,130,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. I mean, I guess to the point that it seems like there's a lot of communities on the SNIC list for  perpetuity, and it doesn't seem like anything really, always happens to them. Right. I mean, doesn't it? Or  am I wrong?  ",1:18:59
2027,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,130,1,Interviewee ,"You're not wrong, but I mean, it's I don't know how you fix that.

2040,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,131,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah. I mean, occasionally DEC does that when there's floods and stuff. ",1:19:39
2035,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,131,1,Interviewee ,You could come in and issue boil water notices if there's a significant health event or I'd imagine that there  might be an avenue where you could come in and someone take over but I've never heard of anything  like that. ,1:19:42
2043,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,131,1,Interviewer 2 ,You don't get charged? Like I'm thinking like an environment?  ,1:19:54
2036,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,131,1,Interviewee ,You can be charged but I don't. You're talking about a fine? I'm sure there is some sort of fine in the codes  in the state of Alaska but. Promoting compliance is much more so than trying to punish noncompliance. ,1:19:58
2041,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,131,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Like if you went to [REDACTED], and were like, Alright, we're gonna fine you $1,000 A day like, would that  make the community better off?

2037,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,131,1,Interviewee ,But I think they focus a lot more on what can we do to get you compliant? Or what do you need to make  it work? Then to punish those that are non-compliant.  ,1:20:38

2038,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,131,1,Interviewee ,I don't know if they go out and do that. But they do have rural workers that go around and assist with  communities with fixing stuff. That's RMWs remote maintenance workers.  ,1:20:55

I'm not sure but I mean, those are the type operations  that go on, they go out and promote it, then they have Alaska Rural water, they have different entities  that will help you with problems that you might be encountering. And then the sanitary survey crews that  go out. You're required to do sanitary surveys; they should go out and catch a lot of things that are going  on that aren't correct. And address it through the sanitary survey also.  ",1:21:14
2042,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,131,1,Interviewer 1 ,"But they don't really, they don't fix stuff. ",1:21:40
2046,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,132,1,Interviewee ,"No they write it up. They should identify it. And once again, you're going back to, you would hope that  identifying deficiencies, they get corrected, you would hope that identifying things that aren't being done  correctly, whether it be sampling or things like that, the emphasis is placed on correcting it, and there's a  desire to correct it, not to just continue doing what you're doing. And that's why I say go look at a case  study where it's possible that people did not heed the advice and heed the warnings. And they kept doing  their own thing. And then the federal government stepped in and said, Okay, we're here. Here's your fine,  it's huge. And you're building a new plant, and you're upgrading your collection system. And we're going  to continue oversight until you go five years with no violation. ",1:21:43

2048,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,132,1,Interviewee ,"They're looking for federal funding. The way to do it, but see, I think that's the differences that come in,  in certain communities. And it's like OSHA, right? OSHA comes in and writes you a fine. The first time it's  like maybe a fix it fine. Second time, it's a fine. Third time is 10 times that fine, right? I mean, so I'm sure  there are avenues or ways to do that I'm not really familiar with them being forcefully administered. It's  more like, how do we fix what's wrong? How do we how do we make it right? I shouldn't say how do we  fix the problem? How do we make your system right? ",1:22:45

If it doesn't taste right or doesn't smell right. But in general, it's usually pretty  tolerable. You don't know if it's right or not. And you can't afford as an entity or as a utility, or you can't  afford to fail. Because perception is I don't want to drink the water. Don't drink the water or you'll get  sick.

And the other thing that's funny here is, is in  a water treatment plant, typically the water treatment plant operators, the water they drink doesn't have  contact time. You ever thought about that? So there's always a retention or contact period of time from  when you touch the chlorine to it to where you have CT time, typically measured at the first tap.

Yeah, there's a little nomenclature on there.  But, you know, typically, most groundwater wells need to be on at least 100 foot in depth before they're  considered good water wells for public use. But my biggest thing is, is that we're chlorinating at 0.7  milligrams per liter, that's our target. Okay. We're only getting out after it goes through that half million  gallon reservoir, which we keep typically full, which isn't necessarily the best thing, but we do. We're only  getting out about 0.25. For 0.3/0.35 demand, milligrams per liter of demand out there. And I don't know  why. But I'm wondering if it's iron or manganese, it's precipitating out in there and taking a lot of that out,  or is it just the debris and sediment that's in the bottom of that tank? ",1:27:19
2071,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,134,1,Interviewer 2 ,Can you check what's precipitating out? ,1:28:27
2065,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,134,1,Interviewee ,"No, I haven't. I have not checked it. But I suggested to [REDACTED] that we clean the tank. He said last  time they did it was a number of years ago. First time they did it. They did it with a diver the second time  they did it with a remote operated vehicle. And I just said, Well, [REDACTED], there's no reason in my  mind, we can't do a really simple way. You got a unique topography here where the tank is on a little bit  of a hill, where it runs down. There's no reason we can't just come up with a really simple siphoning system  with the intake off the floor. And we just sit there on the floor with suction and just low volume and just  get the precipitate off the bottom. So hopefully it's something ",1:28:31

So the last time we were here, a lot of people we spoke with talked about two things.  color of the water and losing their hair or messing up the color or anything. But we have someone else on  our team is a water quality expert. And as we were talking to her about some of our interviews as we  mentioned those two things. Manganese was one of the things that she mentioned. Yeah, it was  potentially contributing to hair loss, hair color, color of the water. Manganese was a big one she  mentioned.  ",1:29:28

So after at 30 years, you've acquired 67.5% or something like that. It's like 68%, just under 70. Based  off a percentage for every year you work. If you elect to continue working, you continue to accumulate  percentage like 2.25% every year. So [REDACTED] But I mean, bless [REDACTED] heart for coming to work,  right? ",20:01

1867,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,111,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah, no, that was I mean, it was real concern of mine, when I was on council is that, depending, I mean,  there'd been other times where [REDACTED] was like, the only thing standing between us and not having  an operator. So I was very interested to learn that, you know, it's like, what's going to happen? And I guess  you're what happens. We hire somebody to come out.  ",21:15
1863,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,111,1,Interviewee ,"Well, we got a call one day and they said, When can you be here? And we said, well, kind of like  [REDACTED], when do you need us? And they said, How about next week? ",21:32
1868,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,111,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So yeah, I suspect, like [REDACTED], there's not. I don't think there's anyone else in the pipe here. Right?  Like, I mean, you might be. ",21:39
1864,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,111,1,Interviewee ,"Well, there are other firms that provide operational assistance here, like [REDACTED] services, and well  there's a couple of firms that do a lot of work in the [REDACTED] area for the different water systems that  need operators to oversee them. And they can provide, I think the other one is [REDACTED]. But there's  a there's a couple of businesses in [REDACTED] or in the surrounding area that provide that, but I don't  know, I don't know too many operators that, well part of it is they don't want to get licensed and pay all  the insurance that you gotta have to contract with a municipality or a city. ",21:47
1869,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,111,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Well, the goal would be that we would hire someone to live here and work in [REDACTED] ",22:27
1865,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,111,1,Interviewee ,"And that's, that's your only way out. Yeah. And that's, that's part of the reason that we were in  [REDACTED] months is we hired those individuals, and then we trained them, and we got them the time  they needed to get their level one, and then they were able to use the there's an agreement where your  time counts towards the wastewater. And we can get them a dual level one in one year. ",22:32
1870,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,111,1,Interviewer 2 ,"So you have to have a level four around or within 20 minutes of the system at all times, right? ",23:00
1866,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,111,1,Interviewee ,"No, Okay, so federal regulations require that you have somebody around like you say, or whatever your  commute or whatever it is, your primary supervisor has to be licensed at the level of your plant. Okay,  your secondary level supervisor can be one level below it. But you can't have a secondary shift on any day,  you don't have a primary shift. So if you have a level two system, you're going to need to have a level two  operator and that applies to the treatment side of it, the distribution side and the collection on the  wastewater, the treatment on the wastewater. So all those things come into play, you can have a  secondary and the thing that we've kind of realized, and those are the federal statutes, why, why can't we  have a guy that works with me all day long, come in on the weekend, and just walk through and check the  facility? Maybe he doesn't make any changes. So recognizing the situation that many communities are in,  they may have a maintenance person that comes in on the weekends and checks the facility to make sure ",23:04
1871,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,112,1,Interviewee ,"there's no leaks or anything like that. But as far as making treatment adjustments, or anything that could  affect the quality. That should be done in consultation with a properly licensed operator, which would be  at the level of your plant, or your system ",23:04
1877,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,112,1,Interviewer 2 ,"So in [REDACTED] we were talking to the operator there, their system is a small, ",24:38

So  there's something around like, because it's small he has to call in to get approval from.

They go  through and based on your profile for your system, they attribute points to get added for each one, and  then comes up with what level you're required to have. You can test one level higher than your system.  So I'm not sure what the system is out there. Where did you say [REDACTED]?  ",25:08

1888,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,113,1,Interviewer 1 ,We can look it up. ,25:53
1883,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,113,1,Interviewee ,"You can look it up real quickly. And you can do a search of the operators and get all of that. But typically,  you know, that would be the level of their system. And when it comes to experience and testing, you can  only test one level higher than the system you're operating. Okay, or you have experience in. ",25:54
1891,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,113,1,Interviewer 3 ,"So if he's operating level [REDACTED], he can't get a level [REDACTED]. ",26:14

1885,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,113,1,Interviewee ,A level [REDACTED]? You can work anywhere in the state. There's very few level [REDACTED] systems in  the state of Alaska.  ,26:22

1886,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,113,1,Interviewee ,"Depends on how their contracted or their agreement is many, many communities or cities or whatever,  have recognized the fact that they're trying to incentivize employees to go out and get higher level  licenses. Because that then allows them to have flexibility when it comes to supervisory staff, whether  they have primary shift supervisors or secondary shift supervisor, city of [REDACTED] will hire you in. It  used to be you got hired in level one, and then you worked your way up when somebody died or retired  or got fired, right. I mean, there would be a promotion or an opening that then everybody would bid on  and you would move up. Now if you come in and you're hired in with a level four, you are paid as a level  four operator.  ",26:39

1887,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,113,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, even if you're acting as a junior on that shift, maybe you're a newbie. So many communities will  incentivize through their collective bargaining agreement or their contract or whatever they have with  their employees and say, when you're a level one license, you'll get paid as level one, but here's the level  two, scale three and four. And promote employees going out and getting higher license or multiple  licenses. Let's say you want them to be licensed in water and wastewater, maybe throw a percentage on  the contract says if you go get a wastewater, and you're hired as water, here's another 5%. And I think it's ",27:26
1893,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,114,1,Interviewee ,"a great thing. I mean, you need to promote that. Now the risk you run, you lose them to a level 4 plant.  Yeah. Yeah. And that's where I say you, you look for these employees. If you have the liberty or the  flexibility to do that. You look for ones that have ties to the community.  ",27:26

1894,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,114,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, that's, but keep in mind, they can ask for assistance on the test. Right? They may have interpreters. ",28:40
1902,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,114,1,Interviewer 2 ,You mentioned the math thing too.  ,28:48
1895,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,114,1,Interviewee ,"Well, they can't help them with the problems, but they can have interpreters if they don't understand  correctly or maybe English isn't their primary language. There are those accommodations that can be  made. And, you know, there'd been many operators that just doesn't test well. They know it. They know  their job. They know what they're doing. They know how to do it, but they might not understand the  questions or they might not understand how to test like I say, teaching somebody how to test. It's a biggie.  If you can whittle out a couple of questions or a couple of answers and get it down to where you're taking  a stab at two that are pretty close. A lot easier. So ",28:49
1899,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,114,1,Interviewer 1 ,"yeah, I mean, that's I've hear too like for a lot of these folks. It's maybe the first time in their entire life  they've had to sit down with it, you know, and take a test this long. ",29:25

1908,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,115,1,Interviewee ,"I don't think there's anything that would, there are many things that you can reach out and apply and ask  and in my experience, is that the board or AVEC has been very accommodating with those individuals. The  only place I know that you can't, is you can't apply for reciprocity. And be granted reciprocity. Unless  you're offered, you have an active job offer. That's the only place I know where you need something like  that. ",31:57

It all has some point value  attributed to it unless it's kind of the byproduct of a different process that it's already been captured over  there. Yeah, there's so they're doing the same thing we're doing here. Right. And the fluoride, we're  fluoridating we're chlorinating we're not on site generation of chlorine. We're calcium hypochlorite. Yeah,  so it's, a lot of other places they generate their own. ",33:55
1930,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,117,1,Interviewer 2 ,You gave me pretty good rundown of like what had gone wrong here. Can you give us a run through again? ,34:28
1928,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,117,1,Interviewee ,"So when we first got here we found a number of things that we questioned as to why they were occurring  and people couldn't answer them. So to give you an example, we went to backwash filter, there's an air  relief on top of the filter. So the process is you drain the filter down, you air scour it and then you fluidize  the bed and wash all the debris out and then you re-stratify the bed, and then you turn it back around, in  essence, a new pack everything down, and then you start flowing water out. Well, when we went into the  automated backwash functionality here, hit the backwash filter, it would drain down for 13 minutes. And  then when the air scour came on, it just blew water out the air relief all over the whole the filter bay.  Instead of thinking about why is this occurring, the solution was, well, we don't want to spray water all  over the place. So we grab a coffee can and we put an empty coffee can over the end of the air discharge  pipe. And we tie wrap that on, so it just lets the water cascade down. So I don't know how long it's been  going on. But it was on all three filters. Well, the problem was that there weren't draining the filters and  giving them that airspace they needed. So when they hit it with air, it could agitate the media and do a  normal backwash. So I don't know how long the filters weren't even being correctly backwashed. We have  redundant equipment here that is offline, turned off. We don't know why. Right. So you know, I mean,  things always break but let's fix them. So one of the air blowers was offline. Right now as we sit here  today, we just checked out this morning, one of the sump pumps that pumps out the backwash debris is  offline. We were promoting going away from the LMI pumps that are being used out here for chemical  feed, trying to promote going to a peristaltic. Part of the reason is, I can take you out there and show you  15 or 20, cannibalized LMI pumps and pieces and parts scattered everywhere. And we don't know what  kind of Frankenstein pumps they put back together. They seem to be working. But how well are they  correct? I don't know. So, you know, we're just finding these things that. Question everything when you  come into this plant, right? The probe over there. I mean, first time around a pH and the pH came in at  8.6. Groundwater. No ain't happening. Right? But we run it over and over again. And well the probes over  two years old, the buffering solution that they have up there's older than that, and they couldn't calibrate  the probe. no stir plate, you know, nothing. So there was a hoc order right there just ordered all those  other things. So those are the type things that you know. Stand running the fluoride blank, I looked at  [REDACTED] and I go, Hey, when's the last time you made up a zero? He looks at me like what? So we got ",34:35
1932,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,118,1,Interviewee ,to make up a zero. And are you keeping it covered and light and temperature sensitive? That type of stuff.  Many of those instances. I can go and tell you we haven't found anything he was doing incorrectly. Could  it have been done better? Yes. Was it a public health thing out there? Nothing we found yet. But there  are many things that could have been done better to provide better water. ,34:35
1939,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,118,1,Interviewer 2 ,"There were a couple, but like, whether they were violations or warnings, I don't remember. In [REDACTED]  there were certainly some postings of some warnings. ",38:14
1933,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,118,1,Interviewee ,"They're up there. So what we found here is first off, they have because they had lead copper hits. They  started doing an orthophosphate or corrosion control program here. But they haven't started doing, well,  they have now because we just started. There was a long lag to do the required testing. To get past the  initial startup and the interim approval to operate to become a final approval. There's a long time where  they weren't doing the required testing out in the field. And the other thing that you probably saw was as  part of the CCR report, they were not compliant on their disinfection byproduct testing. And they had  some hits on it. ",38:25
1936,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,118,1,Interviewer 1 ,Yeah. We talked about lead testing. And then it was some of the water came from [REDACTED]. ,39:13
1934,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,118,1,Interviewee ,"So part of the requirements you have to develop a very structured sample program, which we which there  is there's all identified locations, and then lead and copper is one of those few programs that. You're  familiar doing it but you actually give the sample bottles to the customers and the water needs to sit for  eight hours in that tap, and then it's a first draw. We don't collect it. ",39:40

1935,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,118,1,Interviewee ,"Not generally. So that's one of the few that we don't take, we actually give it to the residents. And then  the theory is, is that we want to know, the lead copper, is it coming from the household plumbing? Or it's  coming out of the system? Right, because we're lucky up here, we don't have really lead pipes. I don't  know if you've ever seen a lead pipe. It's pretty amazing to see. So but they weren't doing the  orthophosphate program testing required, just literally said, Hey, guys, what's going on? And there's three  emails from [REDACTED]. And we got clarification, and then those over there, that's a scheduling program  or sampling program for us required by the state to meet our permit, highlighted in blue. And, you know,  they weren't. They weren't testing. ",40:14
1938,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,118,1,Interviewer 1 ,[REDACTED] and I talked to [REDACTED] ,41:07
1940,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,119,1,Interviewee ,He just flew back with me last Thursday. ,41:13
1945,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,119,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah. I know him, like I worked with him on [REDACTED]. ",41:14
1941,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,119,1,Interviewee ,"They're developing, they were the ones that were did the engineering and development of the  orthophosphate testing program. But I don't think anybody was pushing at a local level to actually do the  testing. So we're required to take one test every two weeks, from here, point of injury. And then I believe  that every three months or every six months, we have to do lead copper. And then we have to take a  couple samples from the end of the distribution system. So we'll start doing that. There's a sample bottle  sitting there in front of you just ordered, and then it was shipped out to SGS. And then I can't tell you why  the disinfection byproducts weren't taken. We weren't here we didn't even know they weren't taken, until  we found out that they weren't taken when the CCR came out.  ",41:18
1946,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,119,1,Interviewer 1 ,"If I remember, right, that was part of what was going on with lead and copper was that initially, they were  supposed to test and didn't. So it was just missing. And it was like, oh, man, we gotta get the city up to  speed because there's, and then that was the thing. That's what came back hot. And like fire department,  right? Everyone was like, oh, ",42:04
1942,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,119,1,Interviewee ,"And then they went with a corrosion control program to make sure that well to try and lower the lead and  copper. So you get to reduce monitoring, that's where you want to do. But you demonstrated that there's  not a problem, you want to reduce monitoring. So hopefully, the corrosion control project fixes that. And  then we come back with good samples. And there's no reason they shouldn't. I mean, the water shouldn't  be too aggressive, but 7.3, 7.4 pH, you know, maybe they have to adjust the pH to cut that down. ",42:25
1947,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,119,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I got one that's a little bit different direction. I mentioned. So like, online training. Are there other places  where you see technology helping with some of these challenges? ",43:04
1943,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,119,1,Interviewee ,"When you say other places, other career fields? ",43:18
1948,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,119,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Oh no, other places within water treatment and distribution where there's technological solutions to  some of these challenges or things that would help like, Could you be, you know, could somebody be  monitoring this from [REDACTED]? Or is there a way to? ",43:20
1944,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,119,1,Interviewee ,Running the plant? Are you talking to the plant? Or are you talking the training? ,43:36
1951,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,120,1,Interviewer 1 ,All of the above. ,43:40
1949,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,120,1,Interviewee ,"So automation, and remote monitoring is huge. And I'm a big proponent of it. In fact, I probably benefit  as much as anybody because I can sit at home. And I can monitor [REDACTED]. And I'm the actually the  AMOSS, which is the alternative method of systems and provision for special exceptions when they don't  have operators properly trained. Like right now [REDACTED] has one, one properly trained operator, when  he leaves to go on vacation, or has a medical emergency or something like that, what they'll do is contact  me and I will monitor remotely. And I can run the plant and everything else. It depends. ",43:41
1954,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,120,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Can you like add chemicals and stuff, everything remotely? Or are you just monitoring? ",44:19
1950,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,120,1,Interviewee ,"I can control chemical dosage pumps. I can change the UV settings, I can adjust pressure, anything,  anything that's automated, that they have the ability to, to input, you know, into the plant, or you can do  remotely, and that's huge. And [REDACTED] had to recognize that fact and also recognize the fact of the  amount of training and knowledge that you get from doing that. It used to be you'd only get experience  if you're on site. If you're now remotely monitoring and controlling. There's a percentage of that time you  get towards training. Once again, it's not like they're trying to limit the amount of experience or knowledge  that a person can get to put towards licensing, they're trying to adjust with with the changing technology,  so SCADA. Y'all know what SCADA is? Right? I mean, it's huge. And automation as it comes out, is the way  of the future. So everybody's monitoring stuff on their phones right now. And you can any place that  allows it or allows you to log into it or gives you the privileges to do it, then the question is whether or not  they want to give you the ability to just read it, or you can write into it. And if you can read and write, you  can monitor it, and you can make process controls. And certain things you lock out so they can't make  process controls or other ones, you actually give them the ability to do it. So when you look at that, it's  huge. And it's a changing thing. So somebody in [REDACTED] maybe leaves, but if they had a remote  control system, however, basic it was somebody in [REDACTED] or somebody else probably could monitor  it. And make adjustments if required. Now, there's no substitute for look, listen, and feel when you go out  in that plant. I can look, I can sit here, when the doors open, I can hear every pump that starts I can hear  when they pull up here and load a truck, you know, you have to be able to do that. And that's why it's nice  to be able to have that maintenance guy go in on the evenings or weekends. And check the facility and  make sure it's okay, and the operator can go do whatever. ",44:23
1952,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,120,1,Interviewer 1 ,Right make sure there's not water shooting out in the coffee can at the end of the reservoir. ,46:25
1955,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,120,1,Interviewer 2 ,"And if we are taking too much time, we can leave. ",46:30
1953,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,120,1,Interviewer 1 ,So wonder if that would be a solution for us. ,46:35
1956,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,121,1,Interviewee ,"It's great, because the water trucks are showing up here now. So plant runs all day. And I like it when the  plant runs, it's easier to do everything. ",46:37
1961,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,121,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So would that would that be could that be a solution for [REDACTED], then?  ",46:47
1957,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,121,1,Interviewee ,Sure ,46:52
1962,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,121,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So what's the capital costs, what's the barrier? ",46:53
1958,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,121,1,Interviewee ,"Huge. So actually, this plant is fairly well automated. But it's automated. But it's at the basic level, it's like  out there, there are certain controls, but they haven't gotten to that next level where everything's  monitored sitting here. And I can make process controls from here. Out there. It's the old touchscreen,  right, it's the old local, the operator interface panel, they haven't brought it to a human machine interface,  or an HMI where I can sit there. And once it's on there, I can do it from anywhere, right, once it's internet  based. But they're talking about that, because the pumps that we were looking at buying for the chemical  feed. They want those to be able to integrate into a new SCADA system. So a lot of times what you run  into is putting a SCADA system in is like remodeling the house. Once you start, you got to be prepared for  what you find and know how far you're gonna go. Because you're not going to put out a bid for an electrical  instrumentation contractor to come in here. And he's not going to work on stuff that don't meet code.  Right. So then a lot of times you're doing a complete electrical upgrade and bringing everything back to  where it's UL listed along with the instrumentation and control that the SCADA system brings. So you  know, all these things that were done that maybe were fine 20 years ago, or you cut a wire, you drop this,  then it becomes a change order, right. Or you go into it with a bid or a design project to where you're  going to do the whole thing from one door to the other. ",46:55
1963,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,121,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So like, a place like [REDACTED].  ",48:37
1959,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,121,1,Interviewee ,"So many systems out there that can be used for remote monitoring. There's lots of packaged SCADA  systems and then you just have to you know, come up with a set of guidelines and develop everything,  how you put on your internet or how you put on a computer based program as opposed to being out  there with a you know, hand off auto switches or stuff like that. ",49:12
1964,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,121,1,Interviewer 1 ,Is the capital cost excessive? I mean is it a lot when you're building a new one? ,49:39
1960,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,121,1,Interviewee ,No I would think that would be just the norm. It's just the new standard. ,49:44
1968,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,122,1,Interviewer 1 ,We didn't ask about that so I'm curious.  ,49:49
1965,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,122,1,Interviewee ,"Everything would be, you know, instead of pump having an on and off, it would have, everything would  have an inverter rated motor where you control the pump speed remotely. It would have feedback loops  coming back to tell you that, yes, it's running or it has a fault, or, you know, it wouldn't just be the basic  on/off. ",49:50
1969,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,122,1,Interviewer 1 ,Is that pretty standard that every new plant that's built is? ,50:08
1966,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,122,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, well, it would be the industry norm. But it'd be sometimes you don't do the industry norm because  it might be a little more complex than what you would want to maintain. That's the other thing that goes  along with a SCADA system. Once you're into it. You've got a maintenance agreement where that SCADA  firm is constantly on call to correct things. You can build a system so automated you don't even need an  operator. But when things go to hell in a handbasket. How do you run it? You lose internet, and the guy  who's running it over there doesn't work, right? Or if you lose a control circuit somewhere, can I go over  to that board and go back to the old school way and turn the pump on? Or do I got to call somebody in  [REDACTED] at [REDACTED] and say, Hey, I can't turn my pump on, can you fix it? And all you get a busy  signal or you get a voicemail? Right? So I mean, it would be the industry norm to do that any new  construction, but then it'd be the individual application as to how far they want to go with it. As far as  automation, and then are they willing to pay, like every application where there's rockwell or iFix or  there's a license fee, every year that you have to pay, there's a maintenance agreement, and then you  have to have the people that can maintain it. And SCADA is quite a field, right? And now that's you talking  about kids wanting to go into the water/wastewater? No, I tell my son don't do that. Right. I mean, if  you're, if you're interested in computers like you are, go in to the automation, go to the SCADA field, and  start writing ladder logic and, you know, structure text, or whatever the newest thing is out there. And,  and use that. Once again, it's, it's kind of like don't buy a stock for the gaming application, buy the stock  that hasn't been found yet, but it's going to be supporting the game application, you know, dealing with.  So, but SCADA is its own beast. It provides all kinds of benefits, it provides all kinds of flexibility. But if  you're in a little, you can be a lot, and you got to have the support to fix it. ",50:12
1970,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,122,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So I mean, [REDACTED] engineers that would know the answer to that question. ",52:25
1967,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,122,1,Interviewee ,"Right? Yeah. I mean, you'd want to know, are they setting up for remote monitoring? Are they building  remote control into it? Or is it just monitoring or none of the above? And then if we're doing remote  monitoring, remote control, have we built a technology into it where an operator can run it locally? When  we lose that automation, and that's, I'm from an operator's perspective, there is no way I want a plant  built that I can't go out there and get a hand dial. I want to be able to hit hand. And [REDACTED] is a ",52:31
1971,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,123,1,Interviewee ,"perfect example out there. They had a brand new plant, they're under a consent decree. So federal  government ordered them to build improvements to the wastewater plant. So they did it. There are many  things out there that you can't take hand control on. It's all automated. It's all built in. So when we find  something wrong, we'll be calling [REDACTED]. So [REDACTED] will go in and try to figure out what's  blocking it out. What's not allowing that puck to run? Okay, something as simple as a reservoir, calibration  on a reservoir, you know, you call them up? Can you build an offset, and you know, we're saying we're  <inaudible> we got three feet of freeboard, so build me a three foot offset into it, and you'll go into there,  put in three foot offset, and then you're good to go. In other companies like [REDACTED], they have their  own SCADA group within their electrical instrumentation department. But once again, you go to a firm  that's [REDACTED] strong, you have that, but they have a hard time getting SCADA techs. They have a real  hard time doing SCADA good SCADA people and a lot of times you have to go out and contract with local  engineering firms that have that. ",52:31
1975,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,123,1,Interviewer 2 ,That's because people in CS don't want to be in water? It's not high paying?  ,54:15
1972,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,123,1,Interviewee ,"I'm not sure. Some of it is probably okay. Okay, so Some of it's probably they're a unionized workforce. If  I'm a SCADA tech, I can make far more money elsewhere, than I can working at [REDACTED], getting paid  the union electrician scale. So I'll go to work as a private contractor, form my own company. So goes back  to what we were talking about earlier, right. You go to work somewhere for a couple of years. It used to  be once you're there for five it's like man, I might as well stick around to be vested. Right and then while  I'm in here so far, I might as well finish it out and get done. Not anymore. That's all industries. In fact, it's  so bad in police and fire they were talking about going back and forming a special retirement group for  them to try and promote retention. ",54:20
1976,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,123,1,Interviewer 2 ,"I have a couple more questions, if that's okay, if we're keeping you. ",55:17
1973,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,123,1,Interviewee ,I don't go home til next Thursday.  ,55:23
1977,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,123,1,Interviewer 2 ,Do you sleep here? You said 24/7. ,55:25
1974,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,123,1,Interviewee ,"There's a little apartment up over [REDACTED]. Okay, so we just bunk there. It works. Only one there. But  we do get along. [REDACTED] ",55:28
1978,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,123,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Is there anything that you need to learn outside of certification? I mean, it's a federal certification process.  Plants are local, what are the things you need to learn outside of the certification process that each person  kind of has to figure out at each plant? ",56:00
1982,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,124,1,Interviewer 3 ,"I was gonna ask the same. So if I can just Yeah, I think. So. There's like training. There's the exam. And  there's actually working. And I think we've talked a lot about the training preparing you for the exam, and  like, cool, maybe gaps, maybe things working, but what about after the exam to actually working? what's  missing there? ",56:12
1979,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,124,1,Interviewee ,"So let me just say, just because you pass the exam doesn't make you a good operator. I would not say that  you're a good operator. I wouldn't even, I met operators that were good operators have been in the field  for years, right. But they come in, they do their job they go home. The good operators, or the operators  that are really beneficial to the utility have a broad knowledge base. I mean, because we've already talked  about electrical, we talked about instrumentation, we talked about signals, going back and forth and  talked about computers, talked about ladder logic, or logic programming. When you bring all of those  things together, then it's much better for you to be able to troubleshoot stuff to understand why things  are happening. It's like right out there on plumbing, waiting for the plant to shut down so I can put the  plumbing parts together. I had electrician earlier that I told him that I didn't think the starter had power  to it. It could be the fuses that are out trying to troubleshoot equipment, whether it's pressure relief valve,  so it's, if you can find somebody that has. It's a thought process, right? It's like, how do I solve a problem?  Identify the problem, I think about what could be causing it and then I started doing testing to identify it.  Or I try switching things out to see if it fixes a problem. It's not put a coffee can over the pipe that's spewing  water out. What's causing the water to spew out? Okay, now it comes down to I can't get water out of  the filter. It's not draining, right. So now why is it not draining? And now I start taking the drain pipe apart.  Right? And I'm figuring out is there something blocking it? I can't figure out if there's anything blocking it  because I stuck a pipe in there. And it's wide open. Well, then I get the manual out and I start reading  about it. And I call the manufacturer and he says oh well there's a stainless steel screen that's about 48  inches that goes into the pipe or into the filter, and it's probably plugged. But the solution was not just to  put the coffee can on all three filters and let it go. It's being able to do that stuff. It's finding an air  compressor that's not working and wondering why it's not working and going oh, look it filled with water.  Okay, compressors don't work well with water. So let's put a new compressor on there. And guess what?  A new compressor went out too, why? Because there's water in it. We haven't fixed the water problem.  So it's a thought process that goes into it. It's not just fixing the problem. It's what's causing the problem.  It helps to know a little bit about electrical, helps to know something about instrumentation, helps to  know plumbing, I mean, computer skills I mean one of the first things that [REDACTED] and I did. <shows  notebook log from past operator> That's the old daily log. What does that mean? There are books and  books. These are daily logs. What does that mean? ",56:31
1981,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,124,1,Interviewer 2 ,No idea. And they're all in books? And you change on your computer? ,59:47
1980,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,124,1,Interviewee ,"You go and you develop a spreadsheet, you know, it's so much easier. I mean, you still might ask what it  is, but at least it all has a label and legible in a daily log sheet down here the what you said and did all day.  that type stuff. Now, the old time operator might not want anything to do with that. You'd rather write it  all down there. But what makes a good operator? Willing to change, keeping up with technology and ",59:53
1986,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 7 ,125,1,Interviewee ,"times, having a good thought process as far as problem solving. Not just fixing the actual problem, but  finding out the root cause of it. That type of stuff. ",59:53
2077,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,136,2,Interviewer 2 ,"Okay, so I just got back from riding in the water truck with [REDACTED]. And we rode around for a few  hours today, I guess about three hours. We went out to [REDACTED]. So we went to the Public Works  office, and then got on the water truck and drove out to [REDACTED] to do some water deliveries. So it's  a 3400 gallon tank with a big pump and hose attached. So we went out to [REDACTED]. So that was really  cool. It really is more beautiful out there. ",00:00
2121,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,141,1,Interviewer 2 ,"So, in my conversation with [REDACTED] driving the water truck today, we were talking about treated  water and the ways of getting your water and I asked him if he drinks the treated water. And he said he  doesn't. So I asked him, What do you drink? And he said coffee. So he doesn't really drink water. Someone  had mentioned something earlier and it made me think of it. But that's funny because coffee needs water.  Yep. So it's not even like he's drinking like, soda that comes from a can or Gatorade that comes from a  bottle or something like that. You know and I should have followed up with what water he uses. But he  didn't collect rainwater or anything else. So he has treated water and then he puts it in his coffee.  ",00:00
2073,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,136,2,Interviewer 1 ,Are the houses huge?  ,00:50
2078,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,136,2,Interviewer 2 ,"[REDACTED] I mean, I also just think they're newer. So I mean, I know they're newer, right? So that's part  of it. They're a little bit farther apart.  ",00:51
2079,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,136,2,Interviewer 2 ,Not towards me. Yeah. [REDACTED] I felt very comfortable the whole time.  ,02:00
2080,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,136,2,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah. Okay, and so he started going to school. [REDACTED] he's been driving. [REDACTED]. He's been  driving for [REDACTED] years. He has been driving for the city for quite a while. He got his CDL through  [REDACTED]. They're like training, like it's it seems like some sort of like a vocational training kind of  center.

2074,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,136,2,Interviewer 1 ,[REDACTED] ,03:54
2081,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,136,2,Interviewer 2 ,"Interesting. Well, let me tell you what I heard and I think maybe we'll figure it out. I mean, I guess it doesn't  matter too much if it was one or the other. [REDACTED]. They had a class going for CDL at one point, but  they needed one more person to be able to run the class. And like another student, and so he, so he took  the class. [REDACTED] And so that's how he was able to get his CDL. So that's really cool. And so he didn't  have to leave [REDACTED] for it, which is huge, right? Because right now everyone has to leave  [REDACTED]. He said, one of the reasons it sounds like people are needing to leave [REDACTED] right now  is because of COVID. Because like, they needed a certain number in the class, and so they don't have ",03:55
2086,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,137,1,Interviewer 2 ,"enough people. So that's what he said, it probably is that maybe they could do it in [REDACTED], if they  had enough people willing to take the class all at once. So yeah, that is that was kind of interesting  information. And but he does think like, yeah, like the CDL training is great for a truck driver. Right. But I  mean, he recognizes they are more than truck drivers, they're doing a very essential service. And so he  was very concerned that there is no training for like the real water side of it. And they have no training.  So if a new truck driver comes in, and is going to be trained, they just send them off with someone. Right.  So maybe they send them with [REDACTED]. Yeah, exactly. They do. So I sort of what we were doing,  definitely not what we were doing, but you know, yeah. And so he didn't quite I asked, but I don't think I  quite got an answer of like, how long do they do that for before they can go off on their own? I didn't  quite get an answer. But that's something we can ask others. ",03:55
2083,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,137,1,Interviewer 1 ,"So what is he worried that they don't, like, Did you get specifics on what they don't get training on? ",07:07
2087,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,137,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah, they don't get training on like the sanitation aspect of it, right. So someone dropping the hose in  the mud, and which we heard this a lot, a lot of times last time dragging it through dog waste, like a lot of  dog waste. He just kept talking about dog waste for a little bit. Because to be fair, as we were talking, we  were standing in front of someone's house and there was dog waste. And so he was kind of saying, like,  look like because of the way it's all set up. Like there's not much I can do for sanitation. But there are  things I can do for sanitation. So he's careful about when he has his gloves versus like not putting his gloves  in places that are too dirty and like he doesn't bring the gloves into the cab of the truck. They stay with  the hose because his gloves are on the hose. Right?  ",07:12
2084,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,137,1,Interviewer 1 ,I mean maybe. I don't remember him driving with gloves on in the cab. I think he put it in his pocket or  something.  ,08:04
2088,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,137,1,Interviewer 2 ,"And then he's very he's careful when he was like attaching it. And I, what's the word for the thing that  attaches them? The little like, cam? ",08:13

[REDACTED] And that's  why he didn't want to be recorded, right? Because he was even talking about like a customer who asked  him if like she could record him working one day for her son’s school. Like wanted a video of him doing it.  And he was like, ""and at first I said, Yeah, no problem. But I thought about it and I really wasn't  comfortable. Because like, what if I did something wrong? There's no book that can tell me"" That was this  thing. He's like, ""there's no manual. There's nothing that actually tells us what we're supposed to do. Just  because I worked in [REDACTED], I know that this is a concern. But there's no standard for training us.""  That was really cool. Because I was like, You know what, that's really helpful because we've been talking  about all of this training and certification for the operators. But what about the delivery guys? Yeah.

And why are we not like growing our own? Why aren't  we getting the people here? But similar to a few other people we spoke with, I was like, so why not? Why  aren't you getting people here? Why don't you have enough truck drivers? People don't want to work  because of COVID. ",14:10
2093,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,138,1,Interviewer 1 ,I heard just not enough pay. [REDACTED] ,15:02

[REDACTED] was very critical of the guys who flood houses or cause problems  because they're standing there on their phone. He was like, they're not noticing the overflow. They're not  listening.

2105,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,139,1,Interviewer 2 ,"[REDACTED] Um, what else did I learn from him? I think he talked about just like city people in the city in  general kind of like having issues. Like there's a structural issue, there's leadership coming and going. But  he talked about like city people coming and going you know, not doing their job. Not really understanding.  I think that's a big part of it, not understanding what the job really entails. Right. So like, you know, that  stereotypical boss that comes in, is like, ""Why is no one working? Nothing is getting done, do it!"" and then  leaving not like actually like, ""how is this going? What do you need to do your job better?"" All the things.  He did talk about that. He likes his foreman. [REDACTED] No, but he did I think seemed to like the foreman.  He talked a bit about like an old city administrator that did the like, you know, do your job better, but I'm  not going to give you any specifics or help. Um, what else did we talk about?  ",18:29
2082,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,136,2,Interviewer 3 ,NOTE: This is a debrief between two interviewers because the interviewee asked not to be recorded.  ,1:29:28

2106,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,139,1,Interviewer 2 ,"He wants like he wants. It was funny because he even laughed at himself for this, right? Because he doesn't  like a lot of oversight, right? Like he likes being able to come in in the morning, punch the thing pull his  paper and go. He likes moving quickly, feeling efficient, feeling like he's getting a lot done, being  productive, having control over his day. ",20:37
2102,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,139,1,Interviewer 1 ,Did he tell you that you were slowing him down? Or was that just your read on it? ,20:58
2107,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,139,1,Interviewer 2 ,"No, no, he did. Like not even in a bad way. I mean, I think I think I mentioned it at some point, like, oh, I'm  slowing you down. He's like, I mean, you are but it's early so it's okay. Yeah. Yeah.  ",21:00
2103,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,139,1,Interviewer 1 ,Because he was like explaining things to you? ,21:11
2108,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,139,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Exactly right. Right. He was being patient with me. So it's fine. And he was like, a little bit distracted as he  was like, trying to check the homes too, we like, pulled into the wrong home at one point. And he like, he  was like, see some of the guys who aren't paying attention like you won't even. You know, people make ",21:12
2115,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 2 ,"mistakes. And he's like, but you got to pay attention. So yeah, he was like I was distracted telling you that  story. Like, yeah, well, here I am.  ",21:12
2109,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 1 ,That is interesting that they do businesses first.  ,21:33
2116,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Oh, interesting. I didn't do any businesses today. Okay.  ",21:36
2110,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 1 ,"I guess if they're on the route they do all the businesses first. So they have a priority list and from there,  they can choose. ",21:39
2117,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Okay. Yeah. So we just we did [REDACTED]. And he said he had [REDACTED] and then he had like, a quarter  of some other route. And so he wanted to do the farthest out first and then come back. ",21:44
2111,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Yeah because they usually have [REDACTED] drivers. Now currently, like a working staff [REDACTED], but  today they're at [REDACTED]. Yep. So they have their normal [REDACTED] load, but now they've dropped  one. And so they have to pick up a little. ",21:54
2118,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Yeah. Which we've heard from a lot of people that that's the way it's going. Yeah, I mean, they get paid  overtime. That's good. Yeah, so what else was I saying?  ",22:05
2112,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 1 ,"Oh, like, what does he want?  ",22:21
2119,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 2 ,"What does he want? Yeah. So he, the things that I mentioned he likes about the job. He wants, like, as far  as sanitation, he's very concerned about that. And he wants like, a, like standard, a standard more  standard training, training for the other guys who, you know, just are new. ",22:22
2113,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 1 ,[REDACTED] ,22:45
2120,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Right. Like, I need papers that say that I'm supposed to do it right or wrong? Yeah, I think that's what he  really wants. And I think that's great.  ",23:16
2114,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,140,1,Interviewer 1 ,Has he gotten in trouble before? It sounds like he's really scared of that.  ,23:23
2122,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,141,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Um, no, let me think. I think in other jobs. Oh, in this one. Okay. So he doesn't like when customers come  up and talk to him. Because he'll be like, at a house and like, some random person will come. And he's  like, paying attention to the water, right. And so he doesn't know where this person comes from, where  their house like, it's not the person whose house he's at. It's like a neighbor, he doesn't know which  neighbor because he's not paying attention to where they came from. And they'll just come up and  immediately be like, when are you? When are you servicing my house? And he was like, Well, I don't know  which house you came from, your, if you're not on my list, you're not on my list. This isn't my thing. Like I  don't, there's nothing I can do for you. It sounds like maybe he hasn't always handled those with the most  tact. [REDACTED] So that I think is I think he's gotten in trouble for the way he's handled customers.  [REDACTED]  ",23:25
2123,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 8 ,141,1,Interviewer 2 ,"Exactly. I don't think they're given any of those resources. It also sounds like so he talked about how he'll  be on call next week. Yeah. And, yeah. And so when you're on call, you could be on call for sewer or water.  Because we talked about I was like, you know, do you do you always do water? Do you sometimes do  sewer? [REDACTED] And so, but he talked about how it used to be that if someone called during the off  hours, there would be an answering service, or just maybe just answering machine that would have  messages for them in the morning. And then in the morning, when everyone came in, the first thing they  would do would be whatever happened overnight. But it's not that way anymore. And they get the phone.  And when customers call it goes directly to that phone, there's no dispatcher in between them. And so he  said, there's problems because sometimes people and this is definitely something that they need to  address because sometimes people like they know how to get around the system. And so if they call in  the middle of the night, or they call in off hours and like I didn't get service and I need to get serviced. He  has no access to the computer to see if they've ever paid. And so you know, if the if they don't quite know  how to handle that they go and they service it and that person doesn't pay. So that's a concern. Because  it seems like on-call makes sense for sewer emergencies. Right? You should absolutely have someone  ready for a sewer emergency. But beyond that. I mean, you might go without water for a night.  [REDACTED]  ",25:20

2192,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,147,1,Interviewee ,Yeah ,08:08
2199,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,147,1,Interviewer ,"That's interesting. So in the training, you said 21 days of training, you said like four hours a day in the  classroom? Was that every day four hours?  ",08:09
2193,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,147,1,Interviewee ,Yeah ,08:19
2206,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewer ,"Whoa. And then can you tell more? You explained some of the driving tests - you had to do - you had to  like, parallel dock.  ",08:19
2200,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewee ,"Parallel park, alley dock park ",08:26
2207,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewer ,What is alley dock parking?  ,08:30
2201,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewee ,90 degree turn.  ,08:32
2208,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewer ,"Woah! That's hard. Wow. Okay. Okay, cool. So how many people pass the training in your in your year or  in your group?  ",08:34
2202,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewee ,"Uh, there was one that quit. Or he left. Like in the middle of the training. And there was one guy, he didn't  pass. Just one. Just one. ",08:45
2209,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewer ,Okay. And you have to redo it if you don't pass.  ,08:54
2203,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewee ,Yeah ,08:56
2210,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewer ,Okay. Got it. Do you think… Did you have a driver's license before you did CDL? You did? Okay. Okay. Nice.  ,08:57
2204,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewee ,Yeah You need a driver's license for a year.  ,09:02
2211,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewer ,"A year. Okay. Okay. Nice. So did you, did you have a driver's license in the village? ",09:07
2205,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewee ,Uh yeah.  ,09:14
2212,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,148,1,Interviewer ,In your village?  ,09:14

2221,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewer ," Got it, nice. Cool. Was your high school in your village? ",09:18
2215,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewee ,Uh yeah. ,09:22
2222,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewer ,Okay. So do you think that training… Like did you learn most of the things that you… Was there anything  you would have added to the training or you think it kind of was everything you needed? ,09:25
2216,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewee ,It was everything ,09:37
2223,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewer ,It was pretty good? Pretty good. Okay. How much did it cost?  ,09:38
2217,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewee ,"Uh maybe like $6,000?  ",09:43
2224,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewer ,"Wow, that's a lot. Okay. Okay. Interesting. Um, would your siblings come and do a job like this?  ",09:46
2218,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewee ,Yeah ,10:00
2225,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewer ,Okay. Do you think they'll use it? Or?  ,10:00
2219,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewee ,Uh I'm not sure.  ,10:04
2226,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewer ,"Yeah, that's fair. Nice. Do you like the management of the drive…? Like, do you like, do you think the  structure works well? Do you feel like it's planned well? And you know what you're doing each day? ",10:05
2227,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,150,1,Interviewee ,Yeah.  ,10:20
2230,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,150,1,Interviewer ,So the system works. The system works. You like the system.  ,10:21
2228,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,150,1,Interviewee ,Yeah ,10:24
2231,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,150,1,Interviewer ,"Okay. And the reason you want to go back to your village is to be at home and to see your family. Yeah,  that makes sense. Is there anything… What else? Anything I haven't asked? ",10:25
2229,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,150,1,Interviewee ,I'm not sure.  ,10:40
2232,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,150,1,Interviewer ,"That's it. Okay. Oh I see some dripping. It's starting to think about it. Good timing. Okay, cool. ",10:40

2213,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 9 ,149,1,Interviewee,Uh I got three brothers that have their CDL.  ,Uh I got three brothers that have their CDL.  
0,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,2,Interviewer 1," Right. So getting into some questions, I guess. How long have you lived in the area? ",1
1,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,3,Interviewee,Just passed my [REDACTED] year anniversary. ,2
2,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,4,Interviewer 1, Wow. You came from [REDACTED]? ,3
3,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,5,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative). ,4
4,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,6,Interviewer 1, And why did you… What brought you? ,5
5,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,7,Interviewee,Job and I wanted to get out of city life. I guess. So I was seeking to move to rural Alaska ,6
6,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,7,Interviewee,"on purpose. If it wasn't going to be [REDACTED], it was probably going to be [REDACTED]. ",7
7,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,8,Interviewer 1, Okay. Uh-huh (affirmative). And what's your educational professional background that ,8
8,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,9,Interviewer 1,brought you to a job in [REDACTED]? ,9
9,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,10,Interviewee,"Yeah. I have [REDACTED]. Yeah. That's my educational background, I guess. ",10
10,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,11,Interviewer 1," Okay. And let's see. So tell us about what you do now. Or actually, why don't you start… ",11
11,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,12,Interviewer 1,"Tell us about what you did when you got… Tell us your career journey, I guess. ",12
12,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,13,Interviewee,Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I did just general field environmental health out of [REDACTED]. We ,13
13,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,13,Interviewee,"serve [REDACTED] tribes. The number of villages can vary depending on which, I don't ",14
14,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,13,Interviewee,"know, which service unit you're looking at or whatever. But about [REDACTED] villages or ",15
15,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,13,Interviewee,"communities and. Let's see. So, I did that for about [REDACTED] years and then I ",16
16,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,13,Interviewee,transferred to… Or [REDACTED] years maybe. I transferred to [REDACTED]. I did have ,17
17,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,13,Interviewee,some education. There's some overlap in my degree program of [REDACTED]. I did some ,18
18,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,13,Interviewee,studying in that ahead of coming out here. And then I transferred back to [REDACTED]. ,19
19,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,13,Interviewee,And then I've been [REDACTED] for about [REDACTED] years now. [REDACTED] ,20
20,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,14,Interviewer 1, [REDACTED] I don't even know [REDACTED] program is still happening. What it was. What ,21
21,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,15,Interviewer 1,was that? Utility management? ,22
22,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,16, Interviewee,"Utility management. Yeah. Utility management, we had that for a couple of years. That ",23
23,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,16, Interviewee,was… I think [REDACTED]. I think [REDACTED] managed or helped manage that but that's ,24
24,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,16, Interviewee,gone away now. We'd used funding. I think we applied for funding through the state of ,25
25,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,16, Interviewee,Alaska to pay for that. To pay salaries and stuff. That went away. We were not funded ,26
26,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,16, Interviewee,"again but luckily, he's still around. [REDACTED]. But yeah, the remote maintenance ",27
27,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,16, Interviewee,"workers, [REDACTED].  ",28
28,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,17,Interviewer 1, Okay. And did you do additional training when you came to [REDACTED]? Because you ,29
29,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,18,Interviewer 1,went to school for [REDACTED] degree. Did you do specific training once you got there in ,30
30,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,251,18,Interviewer 1,terms of certification or just on the job experience? ,31
31,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,1,Interviewee,Kind of both. The certifications aren't really… I did take water treatment certification ,32
32,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,1,Interviewee,exams and I did get certifications but they weren't required for my job and they weren't ,33
33,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,1,Interviewee,required for teaching the test or anything. But we always felt it was valuable to sit for the ,34
34,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,1,Interviewee,exams [REDACTED] so we have an idea on what content might appear on the exam. So ,35
35,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,1,Interviewee,"yeah, I did take [REDACTED]. I got [REDACTED] water treatment, [REDACTED] water ",36
36,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,1,Interviewee,distribution. And water all treated. [REDACTED]. So it wasn't so much as I was a student ,37
37,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,1,Interviewee,in it. I was right off the plane thrown into [REDACTED] that I didn't know so much about ,38
38,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,1,Interviewee,probably. So experience has done a lot for expanding my knowledge on all the different ,39
39,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,1,Interviewee,water treatment stuff around here. ,40
40,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,2,Interviewer 1, Yeah. Okay. [REDACTED] ,41
41,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,3,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,42
42,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,4,Interviewer 1," Yeah. So I'm going to skip around a little bit, I think, because this is very interesting to me. ",43
43,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,5,Interviewer 1,So the trainings. Can you tell us a little bit about the trainings for the water plant ,44
44,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,5,Interviewer 1,"operators, how they used to be? Then I'm also really interested in… Because the virtual ",45
45,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,5,Interviewer 1,"training thing is a new piece, right? And I'm interested. What are your thoughts on that? ",46
46,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,"I don't know. So, the in-person training… One of the things that we learned right before ",47
47,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,COVID; [REDACTED] because everyone is having such a hard time getting their students ,48
48,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,to pass this exam. And one of the days of the training was fluffy and all about the different ,49
49,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,"learning styles, which I took a lot away from because I never… We're scientists, we're not ",50
50,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,teachers. So we don't think about that or we hadn't before and that was one of my ,51
51,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,takeaways. That I think we weren't really addressing the four different learning styles that ,52
52,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,"exist and that most people… Not everyone learns in the same way. And at that training, ",53
53,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,they told us too that the water treatment level one exam is based on 15 different books ,54
54,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,and the pool of questions is over a thousand so you'll almost never get the same exam ,55
55,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,6,Interviewee,twice. ,56
56,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,And it's impossible to study for all of the content because they give you a book. They're ,57
57,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,"like, ""Here's grade one water treatment ABC."" It's supposed to match with the test but it ",58
58,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,doesn't. So that… I don't know. That was really interesting and I feel like that opened my ,59
59,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,"eyes to what we may have been doing wrong in the past with our in-person trainings, ",60
60,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,even though… Sure it was working fine for some people but for some people it was ,61
61,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,"absolutely not working. And so with that in mind, the virtual training, I think for some are ",62
62,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,working well and for some it's never going to work. But I do like with those that ,63
63,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,[REDACTED] has made it so it doesn't consume the water plant operator. It doesn't ,64
64,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,consume their entire day. That it's a couple hours. [REDACTED] but it's three hours a day ,65
65,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,and then they can go do the other things they need to do to keep their water plant ,66
66,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,7,Interviewee,running. ,67
67,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,8,Interviewee,Where sometimes they don't have multiple… They don't have a whole crew of people ,68
68,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,252,8,Interviewee,that can fill in when someone comes to training for a week. That's always a challenge. And ,69
69,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,1,Interviewee,"I think for some places that don't have good internet, it's never going to work. We've got ",70
70,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,1,Interviewee,a handful of villages that don't have a stable internet connection and virtual training is ,71
71,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,1,Interviewee,just never going to work for them. But I think… I don't know. I think the way they designed ,72
72,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,1,Interviewee,"it, it's probably as good as it can be for… Considering we're teaching to… A lot of water ",73
73,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,1,Interviewee,plant operators aren't real tech savvy out here. They a lot of times don't have a ,74
74,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,1,Interviewee,smartphone and… It's still got challenges but I think it's a great interim solution to we ,75
75,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,1,Interviewee,still… The state hasn't lessened any of the requirements or extended any certifications or ,76
76,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,1,Interviewee,anything like that. That they're… They have stuck through all of their deadlines on ,77
77,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,1,Interviewee,continuing education requirements and to renew. ,78
78,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,2,Interviewee,"And even though people aren't going anywhere, the state hasn't changed at all what ",79
79,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,2,Interviewee,they're expecting. So I think it's better than nothing. If that's… How much value is better ,80
80,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,2,Interviewee,"than nothing. But I think it… I don't know if [REDACTED] got… The last time I talked to him, ",81
81,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,2,Interviewee,he just taught [REDACTED] and they hadn't gotten their test results back yet. So that's ,82
82,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,2,Interviewee,always kind of our gauge to see how well trainings go. To see what the pass rates are. And ,83
83,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,2,Interviewee,then we can find out if people were close at least. I think he hadn't gotten his test results ,84
84,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,2,Interviewee,back yet. ,85
85,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,3,Interviewer 1, Do you think that that there might be some selection bias? Is the online training… You ,86
86,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,4,Interviewer 1,mentioned there… People might not have internet. People might not be totally savvy. Is ,87
87,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,4,Interviewer 1,"it a good…? Is it a fair sample to look at tests and say, ""Well, this many people passed."" If ",88
88,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,4,Interviewer 1,you already… Did you already weed out a bunch of people that couldn't show up to the ,89
89,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,4,Interviewer 1,class online in the first place? ,90
90,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,5,Interviewee,Probably. It's tough to say. I don't know the answer to that but probably. We probably are ,91
91,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,5,Interviewee,weeding out some but who knows. The ones you're weeding out might have passed the ,92
92,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,5,Interviewee,test. ,93
93,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,6,Interviewer 1," Yeah. I was just thinking about learning styles and I know for myself, I have a hard time ",94
94,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,7,Interviewer 1,"doing Zoom trainings for three, four hours at a time. I do better in a class. Okay. Well, ",95
95,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,7,Interviewer 1,that's interesting. And you said that the state might be looking at that as more of a pillar ,96
96,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,7,Interviewer 1,of training or do you think you guys will still? ,97
97,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,8,Interviewee,I don't know. Yeah. It sounds like it could be still offered in the future. Maybe not as ,98
98,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,8,Interviewee,frequently. I know he's really been trying to crank out a bunch of trainings. And I know he ,99
99,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,8,Interviewee,was thinking about recording them or he did record them but he was going to maybe put ,100
100,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,8,Interviewee,them so that they're available. He's working with the state to try to make this be available ,101
101,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,8,Interviewee,long term. At least available when in-person trainings return so that if there are other ,102
102,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,8,Interviewee,"hurdles for operators getting to in-person trainings or whatever, if they would prefer this, ",103
103,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,8,Interviewee,that it's an option. There just isn't a whole lot out there. ,104
104,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,9,Interviewer 1," Okay. All right. Okay, cool. Thanks. We might get back to some of that later. I just was ",105
105,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,253,10,Interviewer 1,curious. So walk us through your day in your job now. [REDACTED]. ,106
106,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,1,Interviewee,Gosh. Well I feel like it's just a lot of program planning and making sure that. [REDACTED] ,107
107,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,1,Interviewee,I had a new person each month. Just spent a lot of training and making sure they have ,108
108,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,1,Interviewee,"stuff to do. I don't think our office has ever had [REDACTED] new people all like that, in ",109
109,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,1,Interviewee,my time here at least. [REDACTED]. We did travel and went to the villages when we could. ,110
110,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,1,Interviewee,I don't know. [REDACTED]. So that makes it challenging sometimes. ,111
111,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,2,Interviewee,[REDACTED]. we don't always know two weeks ahead of travel when we're going ,112
112,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,2,Interviewee,somewhere. [REDACTED] we don't have a water lab tech. [REDACTED]. Because for a ,113
113,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,2,Interviewee,while [REDACTED] I was the only one that knew how everything worked in there. And so ,114
114,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,2,Interviewee,I've been really trying to pass that off onto all the new staff. Yeah. I don't think it’s ever ,115
115,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,2,Interviewee,good to have one person know everything. ,116
116,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,3,Interviewer 1, [REDACTED] ,117
117,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,4,Interviewee,Correct. Yeah. [REDACTED] reached out to all the water systems and let them know what ,118
118,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,4,Interviewee,samples they still didn't do in 2021 and any other compliance stuff that they should do ,119
119,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,4,Interviewee,before the end of the year. [REDACTED] ,120
120,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,5,Interviewer 1, Yeah. So you obviously do some training around water systems. Do you ever get to talk ,121
121,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,6,Interviewer 1,to lay people in the region or in the community about water stuff? ,122
122,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,7,Interviewee,Do you mean not water plant operators? Just citizens? ,123
123,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,8,Interviewer 1, Yeah. The community. The public. ,124
124,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,9,Interviewee,Yeah. Probably more when I was [REDACTED]. But yeah I guess just because even we'll be ,125
125,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,9,Interviewee,at the clinic in a village and the health aid will comment about the water. So yeah. I guess ,126
126,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,9,Interviewee,we've talked to people occasionally who aren't water plant operators about the water. ,127
127,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,10,Interviewer 1," So, do you have an example? ",128
128,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,11,Interviewee,Of negative feedback? ,129
129,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,12,Interviewer 1, I mean about piped water or about fluoride or about why people need to be nice to their ,130
130,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,13,Interviewer 1,water plant operator or about? ,131
131,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,14,Interviewee,"Well, I can tell you I ran out of water yesterday. I complained but I don't know. It's tough. ",132
132,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,14,Interviewee,We always do this during the holidays because they deliver a week ahead. Sorry they ,133
133,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,14,Interviewee,"deliver a day ahead. And so at the end of it, you end up with an extra day in your… ",134
134,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,14,Interviewee,Whatever. An extra day of your having to squeeze an extra day out of your water and we ,135
135,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,14,Interviewee,ran out last night. But my gosh. Something someone's complained about with water. ,136
136,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,14,Interviewee,[REDACTED]. The [REDACTED] water systems because the city of [REDACTED] water ,137
137,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,254,14,Interviewee,systems. [REDACTED]. ,138
138,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,1,Interviewee,That they have relatively poor water quality. But it meets drinking water standards. They ,139
139,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,1,Interviewee,do all their testing they're supposed to but it comes out of the pipes occasionally not clear. ,140
140,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,1,Interviewee,I'm still not sure about it because [REDACTED] lives in [REDACTED]. And whenever people ,141
141,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,1,Interviewee,"complain about it he's like, ""I don't…"" He's like, ""We don't see that."" So I don't know if it's ",142
142,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,1,Interviewee,just certain areas of [REDACTED] or… I don't know. That's been one of the biggest ,143
143,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,1,Interviewee,"mysteries to me and it's super concerning, [REDACTED]. As a [REDACTED], you're like, ""My ",144
144,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,1,Interviewee,"God, we need to do something about this."" But I don't know. ",145
145,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,2,Interviewer 1," Well and a lot of times it's people's own house too, right? If the pipes from the connection ",146
146,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,3,Interviewer 1,to your sink are gross. But yeah at my… I live on the other water system and I run in-line ,147
147,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,3,Interviewer 1,filters and it filters out a bunch of nasty stuff from my water too. ,148
148,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,4,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative). I haven't heard much about fluoride recently though. I don't ever. ,149
149,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,4,Interviewee,I think people here don't even think about it for the most part. ,150
150,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,5,Interviewer 1," It got batted down. The last time people had concerns about it, their concerns were ",151
151,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,6,Interviewer 1,batted down pretty quickly. It just didn't seem like [REDACTED] was a place to have a fight ,152
152,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,6,Interviewer 1,about fluoride. ,153
153,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,7,Interviewee,"Yeah. I remember in [REDACTED] though, [REDACTED] ago, when we all watched the ",154
154,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,7,Interviewee,streaming. That was a circus. ,155
155,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,8,Interviewer 1," So, I'm just going over some notes here. Are there things that are different talking to the ",156
156,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,9,Interviewer 1,public versus talking to water plant operators? I'm thinking of end users and you ,157
157,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,9,Interviewer 1,mentioned the thing with water quality and I think you're hitting on some of the ,158
158,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,9,Interviewer 1,challenges of it's really hard to nail down even what's wrong sometimes. ,159
159,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, definitely. Between talking with water plant operators and ",160
160,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,"lay people, yeah. There's a big difference in knowledge and expectations and, I don't ",161
161,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,know. I think a lot of people don't realize what goes into the water at a water treatment ,162
162,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,"plant. That's when maybe sometimes they find out and think, ""Chemicals shouldn't be in ",163
163,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,"my water."" And all that. But I would say that people know. In the villages I think people ",164
164,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,are more aware maybe or think about it more. That there's chlorine in the water and that ,165
165,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,there's chemicals. And I think that's why a lot of times they still prefer their traditional ,166
166,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,sources. I know that's definitely true in probably almost everywhere people have a ,167
167,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,traditional source. But I know… I think it's [REDACTED]. There's a stream that everybody ,168
168,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,loves to go haul water from. Or a mountain stream or something. I know they're up on ,169
169,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,"hills over there. But, yeah. I think most people not knowing anything about the chemicals ",170
170,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,would rather have a raw water or a surface water or some out of a mountain or ,171
171,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,10,Interviewee,something. ,172
172,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,11,Interviewer 1, Yeah. ,173
173,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,12,Interviewee,We ran into that actually a lot with the water plant operators. [REDACTED] we start out ,174
174,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,255,12,Interviewee,"and we're like, ""Look, I know you might have other sources. But for the purpose of this ",175
175,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,1,Interviewee,"class and for taking the test and everything, treated water is safe. Untreated water, ",176
176,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,1,Interviewee,"surface water is unknown and therefore probably not safe."" And so we have to really ",177
177,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,1,Interviewee,"make that clear because a lot of the community, anecdotally, I can say that people don't ",178
178,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,1,Interviewee,"drink the water. They have a drinking water source, a drinking water system. Like ",179
179,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED], they don't have good water quality. It's not listed as a GWUDI or whatever, ",180
180,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,1,Interviewee,groundwater under surface water influence. It's not listed as that type of system but ,181
181,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,1,Interviewee,everyone knows it is. And so they have salt water intrusion in their groundwater well. And ,182
182,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,1,Interviewee,people say no one drinks the water without running it through some other filter or a ,183
183,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,1,Interviewee,Berkey or a RO or distiller. ,184
184,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,2,Interviewee,I think that's the thing they… A lot of times. At the clinic for a long time they had a distiller. ,185
185,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,2,Interviewee,But I know that there's other… At least a handful or two other communities where for the ,186
186,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,2,Interviewee,most part people don't drink the drinking water and it's used for all the washing and ,187
187,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,2,Interviewee,running toilets. ,188
188,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,3,Interviewer 1," That's interesting. So it's the idea of rationing water, right? What you would use water for ",189
189,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,4,Interviewer 1,first and then if you had more water you'd get down the list and laundry would maybe be ,190
190,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,4,Interviewer 1,down at the bottom and drinking would be at the top. But you're saying that there's places ,191
191,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,4,Interviewer 1,that have running water where it's almost a little bit upside down. So they haul drinking ,192
192,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,4,Interviewer 1,"water and use running, use tap water for not drinking. ",193
193,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,5,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative). I know that is definitely true with some people and I couldn't tell ,194
194,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,5,Interviewee,you how many or anything. ,195
195,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,6,Interviewer 1," Yeah. Okay. All right. Because a lot of times when we talk about this stuff, this idea of that ",196
196,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,7,Interviewer 1,"hauling the water, is actually the limiting. The reason why people don't use as much ",197
197,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,7,Interviewer 1,water. But people might be willing to haul a little bit of water for drinking but not haul all ,198
198,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,7,Interviewer 1,of their water for washing. Okay. ,199
199,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,8,Interviewee,"If you think about it, people in the lower 48 or in the cities are willing to haul big jugs of ",200
200,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,8,Interviewee,water from the store because they think it's better. Then turns on the tap at their house.  ,201
201,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,9,Interviewer 1, Let's talk about challenges to infrastructure. You have any good stories about things that ,202
202,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,10,Interviewer 1,broke? ,203
203,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,11,Interviewee,I don't know. ,204
204,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,12,Interviewer 1, Challenges to look at water infrastructure. ,205
205,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,13,Interviewee,"Well, just anytime something breaks or, I don't know. Look at [REDACTED]. That's a ",206
206,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,13,Interviewee,miracle though that they got a temporary water plant up there so fast. But [REDACTED] ,207
207,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,13,Interviewee,"and that was a pretty big crisis. But even when there's, that was a legit big state of ",208
208,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,13,Interviewee,"emergency thing. But even a lot of times when… [REDACTED] right now, I think is frozen. ",209
209,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,13,Interviewee,I think they've been frozen for weeks because one little thing didn't work or the heat tape ,210
210,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,256,13,Interviewee,"didn't get turned on or whatever and it just turns into this snowball. Into, ""Well now we're ",211
211,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,1,Interviewee,"just frozen until we're not."" And it's a lot of times, and I know I was talking to [REDACTED] ",212
212,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,1,Interviewee,about this actually with [REDACTED] because I think [REDACTED] is RMW for [REDACTED] ,213
213,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,1,Interviewee,"and he wanted to just go down there and [REDACTED] like, ""Well hold on. They need a ",214
214,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,1,Interviewee,"crew. Because if it's just you and one guy working on this, it's going to be a week long, ",215
215,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,1,Interviewee,"two weeks long. Whatever."" ",216
216,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,If they don't gather a crew locally so that you can have 10 people working on this that it ,217
217,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,"can be done in a couple of days, that's what should be happening. But they can get ",218
218,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,"crippled by not having a part, not having a replacement part, not being able to get, maybe ",219
219,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,the remote maintenance worker is going to go out and should go help with something ,220
220,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,that's technical replacing of a pump or I don't know. But if they can't get out there because ,221
221,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,"of the weather, you guys have seen our weather out here which, everywhere's weather ",222
222,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,has been crazy. But [REDACTED] had several hundred people stuck at the airport ,223
223,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,[REDACTED] or whatever trying to get out to the villages. And that means no freight was ,224
224,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,going out for any reason and besides [REDACTED]. But that means grocery stores weren't ,225
225,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,getting their food and who knows. If they were waiting on an emergency part for the ,226
226,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,"water plant, that wasn't going. They've got a million pounds of freight sitting at ",227
227,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] right now. So there's, I don't know. It's easy for a small thing to really ",228
228,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,2,Interviewee,compound and end up crippling the whole system. ,229
229,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,3,Interviewer 1," Talking about failures, like you said heat tape not getting flipped on. So how would you ",230
230,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,4,Interviewer 1,"describe. So some of that is. Someone forgot to flip the tape, right? So some of those are ",231
231,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,4,Interviewer 1,human issues and personnel issues and then some of those. So to what extent is it human ,232
232,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,4,Interviewer 1,"resource versus actual infrastructure problems? Like, ""Hey, the pipe was just old and it ",233
233,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,4,Interviewer 1,"broke because it was a million years old."" ",234
234,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,"Well, I think that happens too. I just might not be familiar enough with. Yeah. I think a lot ",235
235,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,of the systems I work with are newer. I'm just thinking about. Because when I had worked ,236
236,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,"as an [REDACTED], we have basically all the villages split up. And so I had [REDACTED] that ",237
237,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,"I worked really closely with. For the most part, most of the systems I had had new newer ",238
238,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,pipes and all that and newer water systems. But I don't know. That definitely happens ,239
239,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,where there will just be leaks. It's so common to go. I would say it's more uncommon to ,240
240,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,"go into a water plant and there not be a coffee can sitting under a joint, a pipe weld or ",241
241,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,"something where, there's always leaks and I think that has to do with aging systems and ",242
242,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,"well, maybe and corrosive water too. But yeah, I don't know. [REDACTED] would be… I ",243
243,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,hope you guys are talking to [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] would be a really good one to talk ,244
244,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,5,Interviewee,to about these specific issues. ,245
245,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,6,Interviewer 1," Okay. You work on the people side of things too. So I mean that's, I guess, a good example ",246
246,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,7,Interviewer 1,"of okay, there's a leaking joint. Is it because it's… Was that reported? Was it corrected? ",247
247,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,7,Interviewer 1,Was there somebody there to be able to do that who had the skill or those sorts of things? ,248
248,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,8,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative). Well and I think a lot of times if it's a small bucket there and ,249
249,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,257,8,Interviewee,they're like… And sometimes they'll ask. I've learned these things over the years. I'll be ,250
250,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,1,Interviewee,"like, ""Well how often do you have to empty that? How fast is this leaking?"" And they'll be ",251
251,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,1,Interviewee,"like, ""Once a week or something."" And then I'll be like, ""Does [REDACTED] know about it? ",252
252,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,1,Interviewee,"Or does your RMW know or do you need help with that?"" But I think sometimes some of ",253
253,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,1,Interviewee,"the simple things they're pretty good. And the RMWs, that's part of their purpose I think, ",254
254,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,1,Interviewee,is to teach some of the lower level skills at least as far as making repairs. They don't have ,255
255,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,1,Interviewee,to go out as often but that's a challenge too because there's turnover. ,256
256,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,There's always… There tends to be a lot of turnover and it depends on system to system. ,257
257,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,So [REDACTED] has had the same two water plant operators. [REDACTED]. My whole time ,258
258,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,"here it's been [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] and then [REDACTED], I don't know who's ",259
259,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,"working there on any given day. It might be this guy, it might be this other guy. This guy ",260
260,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,doesn't work there anymore but he still goes and helps out because they can't get anyone ,261
261,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,else to take it over full time and own it. So turnover is probably one of the bigger problems ,262
262,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,and that contributes to what you were getting at with the human errors. And I think that's ,263
263,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,just because when you've got someone new and their boss is the city administrator or the ,264
264,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,"tribal administrator, who probably doesn't know anything about water treatment and ",265
265,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,2,Interviewee,what they should be doing. ,266
266,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,3,Interviewee,One of the places I have the biggest problem with this is [REDACTED]. The water plant ,267
267,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,3,Interviewee,operator is loved by the city council and he doesn't do anything the city administrator ,268
268,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,3,Interviewee,"tells him to do, even though that's technically his boss I think. But he's like, ""Well, the city ",269
269,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,3,Interviewee,"council is cool with whatever I do. So I'm never going to get fired."" And he does not do ",270
270,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,3,Interviewee,any sampling. He does not turn in monthly operator reports. He does zero compliance ,271
271,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,3,Interviewee,things. If his boss doesn't care and isn't going to put the thumb down on him and if the ,272
272,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,3,Interviewee,"state's not or if the state just, their messaging is falling on deaf ears, I don't know. ",273
273,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,4,Interviewer 1, Yeah. Nice. ,274
274,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,5,Interviewee,And that's a surface water system. ,275
275,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,6,Interviewer 1, I know how local government works. How have challenges changed over time? I guess ,276
276,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,7,Interviewer 1,we've talked about two different things. One is the human side in turnover and people ,277
277,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,7,Interviewer 1,and training and then the other thing of just. You said you got the water plants are new ,278
278,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,7,Interviewer 1,or you just are working with villages now that happen to have newer ones? ,279
279,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,8,Interviewee,I think that it's more of that. That most of the villages that I worked closely with just ,280
280,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,8,Interviewee,"happened to have newer systems. But they still, I don't know. I can think of some that ",281
281,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,8,Interviewee,definitely need upgrades and new everything. ,282
282,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,9,Interviewer 1, Yeah. Has that been happening? How has it changed over time? Have you seen new stuff ,283
283,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,10,Interviewer 1,since you've been there? Improvements? ,284
284,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,11,Interviewee,I have but I think I've heard and I've heard this from [REDACTED] that I know that the ,285
285,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,11,Interviewee,money is becoming less available and that there are less projects than in the past but ,286
286,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,258,11,Interviewee,"again, that's anecdotally. But it seemed, I don't know. I can't tell because. Okay. So, ",287
287,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] water project was [REDACTED] years or something. So it's hard for me. It ,288
288,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,1,Interviewee,seems like I've been here for a long time but when a project could take almost as long as ,289
289,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,1,Interviewee,"I've been in here, it's hard for me to judge that I guess if there's less projects now than in ",290
290,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,1,Interviewee,the past. But there should be or there should be less need. As soon as you tick off the ,291
291,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,1,Interviewee,"places that need a full piped system, there should be less need. But I think as they come ",292
292,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,1,Interviewee,"around, as you circle around it's. Someday, if they ever get around to piping everywhere, ",293
293,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,1,Interviewee,it's going to be time to go back around and do big replacement projects for the ones that ,294
294,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,1,Interviewee,were done first. ,295
295,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,2,Interviewer 1, What about on the human side? Have you seen changes to those challenges? ,296
296,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,3,Interviewee,"No. I don't know. In some places it just depends on who, I think there's a lot of factors on ",297
297,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,3,Interviewee,who wants to be the water plant operator and stick around and own that process. Or own ,298
298,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,3,Interviewee,running the water plant and doing it on their own without having a lot of other support. ,299
299,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,3,Interviewee,"But it depends. Some communities have a utility coordinator and they have other, I feel ",300
300,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,3,Interviewee,like other support staff that help the operators with keeping up on some of that. Maybe ,301
301,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,3,Interviewee,some of that compliance stuff. I don't know. I think it's about the same. ,302
302,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,4,Interviewer 1, Treading water. Okay. So we've alluded to this and it's going to seem a very obvious ,303
303,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,5,Interviewer 1,question to you. Are there particular challenges to operating in arctic environments? ,304
304,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,6,Interviewee,Yes. ,305
305,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,7,Interviewer 1, Forget that you're talking to me and pretend that you're talking to someone else. ,306
306,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,8,Interviewee,Okay. I'll just look at [REDACTED]. ,307
307,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,9,Interviewer 1, All right. ,308
308,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,10,Interviewee,"Well, so yes. I don't know the first one that comes to mind. Wait, a couple of things come ",309
309,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,10,Interviewee,to mind but so we have to make sure when you're delivering water that it doesn't freeze. ,310
310,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,10,Interviewee,"Obviously, first of all. And so in keeping the pipes heated in one way or another and that's ",311
311,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,10,Interviewee,"usually heat tape, electric heat tape or heated glycol. So that's challenge number one, I ",312
312,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,10,Interviewee,"guess. And then also in water treatment, there's an optimum temperature at which you, ",313
313,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,10,Interviewee,"there's optimum temperature depending on what chemicals you add and all that. And so, ",314
314,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,10,Interviewee,"if you have a too high of temperature, it can help. I haven't been to training for a long ",315
315,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,10,Interviewee,"time now. But if it's at too high of temperature, the chemicals don't react the right way I ",316
316,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,10,Interviewee,guess. ,317
317,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,11,Interviewee,And so you want to have the water warm so it doesn't freeze but you also don't want to. ,318
318,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,11,Interviewee,You want to make sure you're not hindering your own treatment process. So that's tricky ,319
319,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,11,Interviewee,"too because you pull the water out of the ground, it's 32 degrees or so 34 or something ",320
320,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,11,Interviewee,very close to freezing. Might be a little higher than that actually but whatever. It's cold ,321
321,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,11,Interviewee,"but so they have to heat it but then you want to, I don't know, balance that. And that just, ",322
322,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,259,11,Interviewee,"I don't know, it's extreme weather we've been having lately when it's really windy and ",323
323,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,1,Interviewee,"snowy and we get, where we are at most places, it's very flat, so we can get really big ",324
324,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,1,Interviewee,snow drifts and things like that can be a problem. But I think probably… What am I ,325
325,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,1,Interviewee,forgetting [REDACTED]. You caught me off guard. What else? ,326
326,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,2,Interviewer 1," Well, I got some more… ",327
327,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,3,Interviewee,There's so many things. ,328
328,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,4,Interviewer 1, … related questions but I think that's… I'm not sure if water systems that… So some of the ,329
329,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,5,Interviewer 1,water systems have to move water. Nothing can stop and I think that's a little bit different ,330
330,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,5,Interviewer 1,than some places. ,331
331,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,6,Interviewee,"Yeah. it's circulating water. All the systems out here circulate water, even if there's… I ",332
332,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,6,Interviewee,think there's usually… It's they have to either circulate the water or add heat. And I think ,333
333,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,6,Interviewee,"most of our systems, they might do both. And then they're almost… Every system I've ",334
334,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,6,Interviewee,"ever gone to and surveyed, they all circulate water because there's a question on the ",335
335,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,6,Interviewee,"sanitary survey where it asked about dead ends and they're were all like, ""We don't have ",336
336,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,6,Interviewee,"any. The water it's always moving."" But that can cause a problem too on the infrastructure ",337
337,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,6,Interviewee,because it wears out pipes faster when you've got more water moving around. So ,338
338,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,6,Interviewee,[inaudible] with the challenge. And everyone gets all up in arms when their water's ,339
339,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,6,Interviewee,delayed by a day or two. ,340
340,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,But think about how that works in a village when they're delivering with a hundred-gallon ,341
341,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,trailer vessel say or 200… Whatever. They're different but a 100 to 200 gallon vessel on a ,342
342,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,trailer. And they're hauling it around on boardwalk with a four-wheeler with chains on ,343
343,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,the tires trying to keep it from flying off the side and yeah. It gets bad in [REDACTED] and ,344
344,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,"people get really bent out of shape about it and they're like, ""What are we going to do."" ",345
345,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,"One day without water and then, I think it's got to be way worse in the villages and with ",346
346,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,"those small haul systems, they just are terrible anyways. But even some places do snow ",347
347,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,"machines where they can. Like [REDACTED], they're a boardwalk community but they get ",348
348,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,lots of wind and snow. And everything gets flattened out then they can move a snow ,349
349,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,7,Interviewee,machine there. ,350
350,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,8,Interviewer 1," They're hauling water with a snow machine. Man, that seems a nightmare. Cool. So I got ",351
351,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,9,Interviewer 1,some other questions related that I will hop back to you but staying on this arctic thing. ,352
352,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,9,Interviewer 1,Is climate change an issue? ,353
353,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,10,Interviewee,Yeah. I think so.  ,354
354,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,11,Interviewer 1," Not in general, right? But for water infrastructure. Are things changing? Is climate change ",355
355,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,12,Interviewer 1,affecting water? ,356
356,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,13,Interviewee,"I think so. Man, I guess I haven't thought about that a lot or not in a while. Well, so most ",357
357,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,13,Interviewee,of our villages are having big erosion problems or a lot of villages are. More than has been ,358
358,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,260,13,Interviewee,"documented. Most places you can find an area where they're having some erosion, even ",359
359,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,1,Interviewee,"if it hasn't been on the news or [REDACTED] hasn't been out there. But [REDACTED], their ",360
360,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,1,Interviewee,school is getting demo’d through an emergency order or something through the ,361
361,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,1,Interviewee,"governor. I think. And the water plant is not very far away from there, which is their ",362
362,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,1,Interviewee,primary… [REDACTED] is lucky in that they have two wells. One is the community water ,363
363,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,1,Interviewee,system well. That's the one that's going to go in the water first. And then the second one ,364
364,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,1,Interviewee,is just tied to their washeteria which me and [REDACTED] have talked about this. He's ,365
365,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,1,Interviewee,talked to the community about it I think and their plan is to just switch the primary water ,366
366,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,1,Interviewee,source to the washeteria well and system. ,367
367,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,2,Interviewee,So they are lucky in the fact that they do have a backup but that eventually will need to… ,368
368,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,2,Interviewee,I don't know. They're going to be leapfrogging away from the river or they're calling it a ,369
369,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,2,Interviewee,slow retreat away from the river bank because it's just eroding away. So I think that's ,370
370,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,2,Interviewee,"climate change. The river bank's not being, but also I think it's part of a natural process. ",371
371,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,2,Interviewee,But the banks not being able to hold where they already anymore because the permafrost ,372
372,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,2,Interviewee,isn't staying frozen long enough in the air. ,373
373,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,3,Interviewer 1, You talked about people seeking traditional sources of water. Are the traditional sources ,374
374,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,4,Interviewer 1,of water changing because of melting permafrost or other? Do of any of examples of that? ,375
375,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,5,Interviewee,I don't. I could imagine that there would be some changes in that but I don't know any. ,376
376,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,6,Interviewer 1," I'm curious about that one because that's one of the hypotheses, is that well, the ",377
377,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,7,Interviewer 1,groundwater might be changing or the surface water might be changing or things that ,378
378,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,7,Interviewer 1,have. Things might be melting and kicking up into that. But I don't know any. ,379
379,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,8,Interviewee,Yeah. ,380
380,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,9,Interviewer 1, Okay. I got a quick one for you. You live in [REDACTED]. Somebody's moving to ,381
381,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,10,Interviewer 1,"[REDACTED]. They say, ""Hey, heard water delivery is crazy. Looking to buy a house."" What ",382
382,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,10,Interviewer 1,would you tell someone coming there new that had heard about some of the water stuff ,383
383,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,10,Interviewer 1,you're talking about? What advice would you give them? ,384
384,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,11,Interviewee,"Yeah. Well, since I just had three people move here I always try to tell people to get into ",385
385,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,11,Interviewee,[REDACTED] if they can. If there's an opening in [REDACTED] for a rental or. Most people ,386
386,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,11,Interviewee,I have come in here are getting rentals but even if they were looking to buy a house. ,387
387,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,12,Interviewer 1, Piped water is what you're saying. ,388
388,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,13,Interviewee,Yes. Yeah. Well and especially it's hard when you are coming from somewhere you've ,389
389,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,13,Interviewee,"never had to think about. Even if you're like, ""I'm an environmental scientist. I conserve ",390
390,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,13,Interviewee,"water."" It's still so different to have to really look at how much water you have and like I ",391
391,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,13,Interviewee,"said, we ran out last night. The other thing, if they were moving here and they couldn't ",392
392,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,13,Interviewee,"get in piped water, I would always advise to get. Live somewhere that has a bigger water ",393
393,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,13,Interviewee,"tank, especially if you are paying for water. So I pay the water bill for our house. It is ",394
394,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,261,13,Interviewee,currently $467 a month. I get 300 gallons delivered twice a week and then obviously the ,395
395,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,1,Interviewee,"sewer gets hauled as well. So again, I have a water truck come to my house four times a ",396
396,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,1,Interviewee,"week, a delivery driver come to my house four times a week. ",397
397,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,2,Interviewee,"I understand why it's so much. But so in [REDACTED], we have a thousand gallon tank in ",398
398,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,2,Interviewee,there. I would've wanted a little bit bigger one but I think that's a middle ground that we ,399
399,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,2,Interviewee,can at least go to weekly deliveries so our bill won't be so much. Because the price here ,400
400,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,2,Interviewee,isn't tied to so much. It's not tied to the gallon as much as how many times the drivers ,401
401,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,2,Interviewee,"come into your house and how much time they're spending coming to my house. So yeah, ",402
402,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,2,Interviewee,I would always say I recommend bigger water tanks so they don't have to come here as ,403
403,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,2,Interviewee,"often. And we're just [REDACTED] and he's like, ""I am this old. I am not going to…"" He's ",404
404,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,2,Interviewee,not going to live like a college student and ration his water. ,405
405,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,3,Interviewee,"Like I have done in some of my time here where I'm like, ""I am not paying that higher bill."" ",406
406,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,3,Interviewee,"He's like, ""No. We're… I'm going to take a shower every day if I want to."" And whatever. ",407
407,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,3,Interviewee,"So yeah. And it depends on too where you live at. So, thank God I live in [REDACTED] or ",408
408,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,3,Interviewee,something and there's Zone [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] probably knows more about this ,409
409,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,3,Interviewee,than I do. But the other zones that [REDACTED] that's legitimately 20 minutes away from ,410
410,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,3,Interviewee,"my house. It's a long drive in [REDACTED]. Theirs is higher price. So, I'm sure if someone ",411
411,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,3,Interviewee,out there. Which hopefully no one out there has a 300-gallon tank. Those are all bigger ,412
412,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,3,Interviewee,houses but it's probably even more out there. ,413
413,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,4,Interviewer 1," I think new houses aren't allowed to have tanks smaller than a certain size, right? I think ",414
414,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,5,Interviewer 1,there was some code change in the [crosstalk]. Yeah. ,415
415,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,6,Interviewee,I think it's still 300. ,416
416,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,7,Interviewer 1," Yeah. 300 is a tiny tank. I always have to explain that to folks that have never done it, ",417
417,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,8,Interviewer 1,that… Because I talk to my parents about it. They have no idea how much. I made them ,418
418,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,8,Interviewer 1,"show me a water bill. They have no idea 10,000 gallons. They don't know. 300 is tight. ",419
419,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,9,Interviewee,"But 300, a single person, I don't know. I had a couple of different rentals here that had ",420
420,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,9,Interviewee,300 gallons or even they might have been even smaller than that. But I would just get ,421
421,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,9,Interviewee,once a week for one person isn't that much. But it's still… It would be cheaper if they came ,422
422,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,9,Interviewee,once every two weeks if you had a bigger tank. So I think the goal would be… And the goal ,423
423,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,9,Interviewee,"for the city honestly, should be to get people to put in bigger tanks so there is less trucks ",424
424,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,9,Interviewee,driving around I think. ,425
425,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,10,Interviewer 1," That's the cost. The water is cheap, the people are expensive. It's the drivers and the ",426
426,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,11,Interviewer 1,trucks and insurance. That's what you're paying for. ,427
427,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,12,Interviewee,Yeah. Keeping the trucks running. ,428
428,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,13,Interviewer 1," Yeah. I want to pause for just a second. [REDACTED], it looks you're furiously taking notes ",429
429,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,262,14,Interviewer 1,over there. Do you have any… What am I missing? ,430
430,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,1,Interviewer 2," Yeah, no, I've been making notes. A lot of the questions that I want to ask are specifically ",431
431,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,2,Interviewer 2,about some of the trainings that we talked about at the very beginning. And so I know ,432
432,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,2,Interviewer 2,some of these might be directly from the questions you have. But I want to know a little ,433
433,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,2,Interviewer 2,bit more about what you think the biggest challenges are for certifying operators. And I ,434
434,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,2,Interviewer 2,know you talked about how [REDACTED] but also if you think that the knowledge from ,435
435,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,2,Interviewer 2,the certification or on the job training is more beneficial to actually operating the systems. ,436
436,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,Yeah. My gosh. Yes. So the operator certification is a nightmare in Alaska. I don't know if ,437
437,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,it is another places too. I imagine it's not very different state from state. So I think it was ,438
438,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,right after I moved here. I want to say it was in 2013 or something that the state moved ,439
439,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,to the ABC testing company… Whatever. Association of Board… Whatever they are. I hate ,440
440,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,that acronym. The ABC people. And that exam is not… This does not correspond with a ,441
441,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,"lot of what happens out here. All the questions about chlorine gas, they know nothing ",442
442,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,about. That is not… So there's just… And that's just an example that there's a ton of ,443
443,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,questions about things that they do not see in their day to day… In their job. Even if ,444
444,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,"they've worked there for 10 years, there will be so many things that they just don't see ",445
445,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,3,Interviewee,hands on. It doesn't click because they don't have any real world experience with it. ,446
446,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,And they're… They come up with… The way the state comes up with the levels of… Or ,447
447,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,"water treatment one or water treatment two, whatever, that's probably fine. But I just… ",448
448,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,It doesn't correlate with what is shown on the test and… Yeah. I don't know. The state for ,449
449,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,"a long time and I think [REDACTED] said they're talking about this again, doing systems ",450
450,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,specific certifications. The state has hired many contractors and spent lots of money on ,451
451,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,trying to develop system specific certifications. So they could just be… It's like when you ,452
452,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,do a sanitary survey or something. They've got the system components. Their source ,453
453,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,"waters is a well, they add permanganate, they add chlorine, whatever. That there would ",454
454,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,be an educational packet or presentation or something like a training for each component ,455
455,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,4,Interviewee,and then there would be an exam for each of those two. ,456
456,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,5,Interviewee,"And they… But their certification wouldn't transfer to another water system. So, they're ",457
457,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,5,Interviewee,only certified for [REDACTED] or whatever. And that's a solution that I could get behind ,458
458,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,5,Interviewee,because… I don't… And I don't… I never really saw. I think they switched over to the new ,459
459,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,5,Interviewee,test before I ever saw what they had previously given for the level one through four that ,460
460,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,5,Interviewee,was the state test. But I always heard that it was easier and we had lots of… We still have ,461
461,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,5,Interviewee,lots of operators that are still carrying that certification and renewing it every year. That ,462
462,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,5,Interviewee,I don't know. We just heard that it was so much more difficult and we thought for ,463
463,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,5,Interviewee,"ourselves [REDACTED] we're like, ""We're teaching what is in the book. We're teaching the ",464
464,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,5,Interviewee,"content that is in the level grade one water treatment book. What's the disconnect?"" ",465
465,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,6,Interviewee,And I still think the disconnect is that we are not given all of the information that's going ,466
466,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,6,Interviewee,"to be on the exam and they're pulling it from everywhere. And when we [REDACTED], ",467
467,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,6,Interviewee,some of the people that were there were on the committee that helped form the exam ,468
468,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,6,Interviewee,and stuff with ABC as representatives of Alaska and… Yeah. I don't know. I don't. We've ,469
469,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,263,6,Interviewee,"got some operators that have taken that level one exam five, six times maybe more ",470
470,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,1,Interviewee,"because it's like the state is like, ""You have to be certified. You have to take this exam. ",471
471,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,1,Interviewee,"You have to, have to, have to."" And so they just keep trying and they're… I don't know. I ",472
472,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,1,Interviewee,feel we're getting to the definition of an insanity or whatever. You just keep trying the ,473
473,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,1,Interviewee,same thing over again and expecting a different result when we're not really doing ,474
474,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,1,Interviewee,anything differently. ,475
475,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,2,Interviewer 2, Yeah. And they may be able to operate the system safely but not pass the test. ,476
476,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,3,Interviewee,Yes. ,477
477,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,4,Interviewer 2, Okay. ,478
478,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,5,Interviewee,Yep. That is something I learned right away when I moved out here and I feel like I learned ,479
479,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,5,Interviewee,that from [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. That we had an operator. We still… I think there's ,480
480,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,5,Interviewee,still one of our operators that we're all pretty sure that man cannot read. Zero grade ,481
481,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,5,Interviewee,reading level. Cannot read but he can run the water plant. But then the state says they ,482
482,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,5,Interviewee,"won't let someone read them the exam because they say, ""If you can't read, then you ",483
483,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,5,Interviewee,"can't read chemical labels and you can't read…"" Which I can't argue with that entirely. But ",484
484,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,5,Interviewee,"if they know… If someone showed them hands on and said, ""This is what you do with this. ",485
485,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,5,Interviewee,"This is how you use it."" They could be doing it safely and doing it correctly but just because ",486
486,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,5,Interviewee,they can't read they're totally discredited. ,487
487,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,6,Interviewer 2, Yeah. ,488
488,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,7,Interviewer 1, Well and there might not be their… I think that's… There might not be five other people ,489
489,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,8,Interviewer 1,in line to take over who can read. That's the problem. It's that do you want a water plant ,490
490,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,8,Interviewer 1,operator that can't pass a test or do you want no water plant operator? ,491
491,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,9,Interviewee,Yeah. Do you want water to still continue flowing and…? ,492
492,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,10,Interviewer 2," Yeah. And I have a couple of more but [REDACTED], do you want to just to make sure ",493
493,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,11,Interviewer 2,we're staying on the list? ,494
494,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,12,Interviewer 1, Yeah. Sure. I was just… We were into the management section. ,495
495,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,13,Interviewer 2, Yeah. And I'll pipe in with my other notes. ,496
496,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,14,Interviewer 1, Yeah. So you do or have done education with water plant operators. [REDACTED]. So tell ,497
497,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,15,Interviewer 1,us about workforce development. Are you filling those positions? Is there turnover? Is it ,498
498,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,15,Interviewer 1,hard to hire people? Is it hard to train them? Who are these people? ,499
499,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,16,Interviewee,"They're… Well, I think we had no applicants for a while. We had… We knew [REDACTED] ",500
500,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,16,Interviewee,was leaving. [REDACTED] left. So then that made my position… Whatever. We had two ,501
501,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,264,16,Interviewee,positions open and then we had… [REDACTED] ,502
502,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,1,Interviewer 1, Why is it hard to find people for these jobs? ,503
503,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,2,Interviewee,I don't know. I wanted to come up here really bad. So I think just remoteness. I think ,504
504,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,2,Interviewee,"COVID is not helping things, honestly. Because even when we were trying to sell people ",505
505,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,2,Interviewee,"on coming up here, it's a lot of the aspects that people love about [REDACTED] and the ",506
506,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,2,Interviewee,gathering and all of the community events has been on pause. And so that's hard to ,507
507,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,2,Interviewee,promote that selling point. That's not really happening so much right now. But I think ,508
508,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,2,Interviewee,"[REDACTED], it's always hard to get people to come out here or good knowledgeable ",509
509,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,2,Interviewee,people. [REDACTED] ,510
510,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,3,Interviewer 1," It seems over time though those [REDACTED] positions have always… Well, there's been ",511
511,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,4,Interviewer 1,turnover because you are hiring people right out of school. It seems they've always filled ,512
512,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,4,Interviewer 1,in what I'd understood or what I've heard from multiple people over the years is that if ,513
513,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,4,Interviewer 1,"you want to do environmental health, [REDACTED] has a real… There's real stuff to do. ",514
514,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,4,Interviewer 1,It's not… You're not inspecting an Arby's in [REDACTED] or wherever. ,515
515,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,5,Interviewee,[REDACTED] Yeah. I don't know. [REDACTED] Because I wonder… I try to get these people ,516
516,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,5,Interviewee,to come up here and then I wonder how happy they are and if they're fulfilled in living ,517
517,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,5,Interviewee,"here and working here. I feel a little responsible for that, even though I probably ",518
518,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,5,Interviewee,shouldn't. But I don't know. And I don't know if it's… Usually we're not in a hurry but ,519
519,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,5,Interviewee,usually we… Our office finds out well in advance when someone's going to leave because ,520
520,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,5,Interviewee,they're moving and transitioning into a different career maybe or job or something. Trying ,521
521,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,5,Interviewee,"to think of when [REDACTED] left, when [REDACTED] left we knew months in advance. ",522
522,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,6,Interviewee,[REDACTED] So I think we were a little uniquely in a position where we were like all of a ,523
523,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,6,Interviewee,"sudden, we were going to have no staff. And I think that's a lot or partially due to COVID ",524
524,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,6,Interviewee,and [REDACTED]. But it was also to preserve our jobs because we were worried. We ,525
525,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,6,Interviewee,"weren't doing travel. We were worried we were going to get laid off. So, at the beginning ",526
526,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,6,Interviewee,"of this, our [REDACTED] was doing layoffs. ",527
527,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,7,Interviewer 1, Yep. That did happen. ,528
528,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,8,Interviewee,"So, we needed to… Yeah. And so we needed to really show our value and what we could ",529
529,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,8,Interviewee,do and then [REDACTED]. ,530
530,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,9,Interviewer 1," So, with the… I don't want to call them kids. With the younger folks that you're bringing ",531
531,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,10,Interviewer 1,"up, with the new people, do you feel… I'm talking about training. How does their ",532
532,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,10,Interviewer 1,educational background…? How important is that compared to what they're learning on ,533
533,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,10,Interviewer 1,"the job? Could you… Like in [REDACTED], generally the certification that [REDACTED] are ",534
534,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,10,Interviewer 1,"expected to get, how important is formal training and certification versus experience on ",535
535,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,10,Interviewer 1,"the job training, traveling out with you or with [REDACTED] or whoever? ",536
536,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,11,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think they're both valuable because I can tell with… One of our ,537
537,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,11,Interviewee,new staff didn't do a co-step with [REDACTED] and didn't come from a program where ,538
538,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,265,11,Interviewee,"they had a water class, air class, where they did general environmental health like the ",539
539,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] program did. And so I had a class on water. That's all we talked about. ,540
540,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,1,Interviewee,Drinking water and I think we also talked about wastewater. And I think we talked about ,541
541,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,1,Interviewee,drinking and wastewater in that class. That was a whole semester and very in depth on ,542
542,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,1,Interviewee,"water stuff. And I'm finding out that a couple of my new staff didn't have that. And so, I'm ",543
543,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,1,Interviewee,actually having them go sit through [REDACTED] water treatment training to bring up their ,544
544,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,1,Interviewee,background knowledge at least a little bit. And I think his schedule has worked out well ,545
545,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,1,Interviewee,for us to be able to attend it too. But it's I think both. I think you have to have some ,546
546,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,1,Interviewee,background knowledge and a base and then learn… Fill in the rest hands-on when you get ,547
547,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,1,Interviewee,out here. ,548
548,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,2,Interviewer 1," Okay. We got a couple of hard questions, I think, talking about what's the solution? If you ",549
549,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,3,Interviewer 1,"could do anything, if you could wave a magic wand and we could just fix some of these ",550
550,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,3,Interviewer 1,"problems, what's… So you've talked about staffing, you've talked about training, you've ",551
551,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,3,Interviewer 1,talked about physical infrastructure of water plants. What would you do about it if you ,552
552,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,3,Interviewer 1,had whatever you needed? What do you need? ,553
553,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,4,Interviewee,I don't know. I think more of a structured training in the water plant with operator with ,554
554,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,4,Interviewee,"his system. It's not just the RMW stop by and be like ""Do, do, do, do… I'm here for this ",555
555,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,4,Interviewee,"specific problem."" Or whatever. But if there was… If that's incredibly… That would be ",556
556,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,4,Interviewee,incredibly time intensive and that doesn't solve the problem of turnover but it might. ,557
557,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,4,Interviewee,Because if operators feel like they're better prepared and know more about what they're ,558
558,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,4,Interviewee,"doing and feel confident in the job they're doing that they might not be as inclined to quit, ",559
559,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,4,Interviewee,seek other employment. But I think… I don't know. I think training and increasing the ,560
560,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,4,Interviewee,operator's confidence is probably one of the biggest things that could make a difference ,561
561,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,4,Interviewee,in. ,562
562,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,5,Interviewee,"And honestly if the operator is confident in the water they're making, then that'll help. I ",563
563,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,5,Interviewee,think it could transfer over to the customers too if they've got someone that's ,564
564,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,5,Interviewee,"knowledgeable and certified, whatever, as much as I don't hold a lot of value in ",565
565,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,5,Interviewee,"certification. But if they've got their certifications, they do all their testing that they… And ",566
566,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,5,Interviewee,"they can, I don't know, really have that confidence in that they're providing good water ",567
567,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,5,Interviewee,"to their community, then I think that that could… It has potential at least to transfer to ",568
568,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,5,Interviewee,the community. Some people at least. ,569
569,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,6,Interviewer 2, And to follow up on that idea a little bit as well. So you think it's the importance of this ,570
570,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,7,Interviewer 2,"onsite hands on training, not just the certification training or by the books, right? Do you ",571
571,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,7,Interviewer 2,think that that would be valuable? ,572
572,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,8,Interviewee,"Yeah. Because then it's not as… It wouldn't be as conceptual, which I think that's difficult. ",573
573,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,8,Interviewee,It's difficult for me sometimes to just think about things that aren't a tangible object. And ,574
574,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,8,Interviewee,so I don't know. I think that would have the most value. But then they would also need… ,575
575,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,8,Interviewee,I think it is important to have the background in some of the stuff that they go over. Day ,576
576,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,266,8,Interviewee,one stuff that's at most water treatment trainings about the different bacteria. And I think ,577
577,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,1,Interviewee,it's good to at least have a base for that. Maybe they don't need to be able to teach that ,578
578,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,1,Interviewee,class but… ,579
579,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,2,Interviewer 2, Yeah. Okay. So having both. And you've touched on this but to make sure I have the ,580
580,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,3,Interviewer 2,"answer clear, what resources do you think are the most helpful when training operators? ",581
581,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,3,Interviewer 2,"And in addition to that, what additional resources would you need or do you think would ",582
582,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,3,Interviewer 2,be helpful? ,583
583,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,4,Interviewee,"Man, I don't know. I think a lot of times anything they can do hands on. [REDACTED] But ",584
584,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,4,Interviewee,they made a model [REDACTED] mixed media filter. [REDACTED] There's three layers of ,585
585,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,4,Interviewee,things. And so it's a model and then he can show. They fill it up with water and then they ,586
586,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,4,Interviewee,"actually show how it should be working normally. We put dirty water in it. ""Look, here's ",587
587,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,4,Interviewee,"dirty water. Throw it through the filter."" And then they even backwash it and it is just a… ",588
588,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,4,Interviewee,I think it's a really good hands-on example. ,589
589,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,"And then in our trainings too, which is a pain in the butt to lug around but we've got all of ",590
590,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,"these parts from water plants that they took to [REDACTED], the welder in town, years ",591
591,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,ago and had him dissect them in half so you can see inside of it and you can see inside. ,592
592,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,"When you turn the valve this way, it's opening the flapper this way or whatever. There's ",593
593,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,a lot of things like that. Then we pass them around or we have them all out on a table and ,594
594,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,"we say, ""Come up and look at them and touch them and open them."" So I think that stuff ",595
595,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,"always works really well where you can really show them hands on and… Because man, ",596
596,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,with video… You can have the best videos in the world but it's so easy. Someone could ,597
597,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,just be sitting there and tune out for two minutes and what did they get? I don't… I guess ,598
598,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,that could happen any time. But I think when you're just showing Zoom and videos and I ,599
599,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,think that's a concern but it is what it is. You can't… It's hard to maintain everyone's ,600
600,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,5,Interviewee,attention. ,601
601,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,6,Interviewer 2, That's really cool though. Sorry. ,602
602,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,7,Interviewer 1," Talking about the training, more focus training and the hands-on things and maybe ",603
603,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,8,Interviewer 1,"training at the water plants, is that a… Why don’t we have that? Is that just the money ",604
604,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,8,Interviewer 1,problem or are there other barriers to making that work? ,605
605,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,9,Interviewee,I think probably time… Other than money but time. We're a big region and we have a lot ,606
606,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,9,Interviewee,of water plants. And so I think having the bodies to go to each village and do trainings like ,607
607,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,9,Interviewee,that would just be… It would be really difficult. But it wouldn't be needed everywhere ,608
608,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,9,Interviewee,"either. Some of the places that… Like [REDACTED], they've had the same operator there ",609
609,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,9,Interviewee,forever in that they know everything. They don't need us to come out and show them ,610
610,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,9,Interviewee,anything. They hardly ever call their RMW. You know what I mean? And we've got a ,611
611,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,9,Interviewee,handful of places like that. That they… Business as usual and they call the Remote ,612
612,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,9,Interviewee,Maintenance Worker when they need to but it's generally rare. ,613
613,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,10,Interviewer 2, And another follow-up question about operator training as well is… And you touched on ,614
614,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,267,11,Interviewer 2,this a little bit when you were talking at the very beginning about how in training you have ,615
615,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,1,Interviewer 2,"to first say, ""This water is good to drink. It's clean. Treated water is clean."" But more ",616
616,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,1,Interviewer 2,"generally, how do you think public perceptions and attitudes towards water influence ",617
617,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,1,Interviewer 2,how operators are trained or how they should be trained? ,618
618,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,2,Interviewee,"I don't know. I think it's… Well, what they learn at training and the aspect… I don't know. ",619
619,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,2,Interviewee,The way it's… The way the information's provided at trainings and when you're talking ,620
620,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,2,Interviewee,"with the state about drinking water and all that, it's different than talking with regular ",621
621,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,2,Interviewee,people I guess. But I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't really know. I don't know if I have a ,622
622,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,2,Interviewee,good answer for that. ,623
623,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,3,Interviewer 1, I kind of like that idea though that you brought up in two pieces is that it seems there are ,624
624,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,4,Interviewer 1,some operators who are not that into treated water. And then on the other hand if we ,625
625,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,4,Interviewer 1,"had operators that were very confident, they would almost be community advocates. ",626
626,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,5,Interviewee,Right. Yeah. ,627
627,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,6,Interviewer 1, Like we see with dental health aids or other things. And so maybe that's… Is there a role? ,628
628,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,7,Interviewer 1,Are there examples of water plant operators that fill that role one way or the other either ,629
629,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,7,Interviewer 1,"like, ""Yeah, I work there but I don't really care."" Or, ""Yeah I do this. I know about it. You ",630
630,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,7,Interviewer 1,"need to drink this water. Come on guys."" Are there examples of that or do you think that's ",631
631,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,7,Interviewer 1,an important piece or are water plant operators…? ,632
632,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,8,Interviewee,I think it's so important. I think it's important. I think it's more important than people ,633
633,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,8,Interviewee,"realize. And honestly, one of the things [REDACTED] has been doing and I hear during ",634
634,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,8,Interviewee,[REDACTED]. [REDACTED] put out a commercial that saying basically how important the ,635
635,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,8,Interviewee,water plant operator is and think about the water plant operator today and all of this. ,636
636,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,8,Interviewee,Because I think water plant operator and health aid are some of the hardest jobs in the ,637
637,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,8,Interviewee,village because everyone wants to point a finger at somebody. If something's wrong with ,638
638,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,8,Interviewee,the water it's all your fault. You didn't do something right. Whatever. Even if it's not. In ,639
639,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,8,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] sometimes it's the homeowner maybe didn't do something right. But yeah, I ",640
640,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,8,Interviewee,feel it's hard if they don't… If they're not confident in what they're doing. ,641
641,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,9,Interviewee,"That they need that in order to be successful. Man, I'm trying to… I don't know. I'm trying ",642
642,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,9,Interviewee,"to think of… Because even in [REDACTED], they're our golden child but even they have ",643
643,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,9,Interviewee,problems out there. One time I think I was on my way out there and I started talking to ,644
644,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,9,Interviewee,"this guy at the airport and he was like, ""Where are you going?"" So I mentioned ",645
645,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,9,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] and he was like, ""I just came from out there."" He is like, ""Don't drink the ",646
646,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,9,Interviewee,"water. They add bleach to it."" And I was like, ""What?"" I didn't even… I think I walked away ",647
647,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,9,Interviewee,"because I was like, ""Yes. Okay. Everybody does, I guess technically. But I don't know."" So ",648
648,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,9,Interviewee,it's difficult. ,649
649,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,10,Interviewer 1, We just heard the water in [REDACTED] was very good. We just had a… We got glowing ,650
650,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,268,11,Interviewer 1,reviews of the [REDACTED] water. It was better than [REDACTED]. ,651
651,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,Yeah. But even some of our best operators they don't deal very well with confrontation ,652
652,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,from the community. I can think of where I've been involved before in one of the ,653
653,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,"communities where somebody overheard… It was all about the CCR, the Consumer ",654
654,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,"Confidence Report that is required, gets sent out and done every year. And that someone ",655
655,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,was talking and overheard contaminants or something. And then that was like all these ,656
656,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,rumors start going around. And then the water plant operator wanted me to deal with it. ,657
657,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,"And I was… But it was just a rumor. I don't… I'm like, ""You know your wire. You need to ",658
658,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,"address this."" I'm like, ""You know you do your testing, you have your CCR, you know you ",659
659,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,"don't have violations."" You know what I mean? And so sometimes we've got that where… ",660
660,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,I can think of a few times where we've had that come up. Where the operator… People… ,661
661,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,The community is outraged at the operator because they think something and it's not ,662
662,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,true at all. You should never have the community trying to burn the water plant operator ,663
663,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,1,Interviewee,at the stake. Gosh. No wonder they quit. ,664
664,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,2,Interviewer 1," Yeah. Well, that's interesting because that's probably not part of the water treatment ",665
665,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,3,Interviewer 1,certification is dealing with the public. I'm guessing there's probably not any piece to ,666
666,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,3,Interviewer 1,public relations or advocating or… ,667
667,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,4,Interviewee,They talk about public notifications. ,668
668,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,5,Interviewer 1," Right. So it's a letter that says, ""Your water was bad this week. Oops."" That's what we do ",669
669,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,6,Interviewer 1,in [REDACTED]. I got one of those. ,670
670,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,7,Interviewee,Uh-huh (affirmative). Yeah. ,671
671,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,8,Interviewer 1," Well [REDACTED], we're pushing time. What do you…? Is there any… You got any burning ",672
672,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,9,Interviewer 1,questions here that we should hit on? ,673
673,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,10,Interviewer 2, I don't think so. I was just looking through… Yeah. I guess any… Do you have any other ,674
674,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,11,Interviewer 2,thoughts that you want to add or…? ,675
675,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,12,Interviewer 1, What should we have asked you? ,676
676,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,13,Interviewer 2, Yeah. Is something that we didn't ask you that we should have? ,677
677,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,14,Interviewee,"I don't know. No, I don't know. I think you guys asked me a lot. I wish I had better answers ",678
678,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 15 ,269,14,Interviewee,"for some of your questions. But no, I don’t know. This was fun. [REDACTED] ",679
679,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,2,Interviewer 2,"Okeydokey. Cool, all right. So just some background, kind of went over the fact ",1
680,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,2,Interviewer 2,"here, so you moved to [REDACTED], but how long were you in [REDACTED]? ",2
681,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,3,Interviewee,"I was in [REDACTED] a minimum of [REDACTED] years straight, total. And at the ",3
682,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,3,Interviewee,"end of that time, I was the [REDACTED], before I left there. So I spent some time ",4
683,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,3,Interviewee,"in the villages early on, but mostly it's all been in [REDACTED]. ",5
684,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,4,Interviewer 2,"Oh, okay. Well, so, see, I didn't know that. Yeah, walk us through, where were ",6
685,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,4,Interviewer 2,"you, or what brought you to the region?  ",7
686,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,5,Interviewee,"Well, I mean, we had a bad economy crash in [REDACTED], this is where I've spent ",8
687,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,5,Interviewee,my whole life. My first plane ride was to Alaska when that happened. So ,9
688,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,5,Interviewee,"everybody was losing their jobs, and I saw an ad in the paper for a $10,000 ",10
689,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,5,Interviewee,"completion bonus of a contract for a [REDACTED], and I just kind of fell in love ",11
690,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,5,Interviewee,with the state and ended up in [REDACTED].  ,12
691,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,6,Interviewer 2,"Okay. You were in the village too, though?  ",13
692,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,7,Interviewee,"I did, I was a [REDACTED] in [REDACTED], I spent about [REDACTED] years out ",14
693,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,7,Interviewee,"there. And there's a little bit different, they have a piped system which I don't ",15
694,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,7,Interviewee,"know much about, they use vacuum for their waste. But yeah, it's a little bit ",16
695,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,7,Interviewee,different than what [REDACTED] has going on.  ,17
696,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,8,Interviewer 2,"Yeah, I think [REDACTED] has one of those weird vacuum toilets, right?  ",18
697,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,9,Interviewee,"They do. Yeah, so like there'll be a leak, and they'll go around to everybody's ",19
698,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,9,Interviewee,"house trying to figure out where the leak's at. It's obnoxious, but it works, for the ",20
699,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,9,Interviewee,most part.  ,21
700,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,10,Interviewer 2,"Yeah, okay. Well I didn't know you were out in [REDACTED], so the questions are ",22
701,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,10,Interviewer 2,"kind of based on your experience, and so if you have different experience or ideas ",23
702,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,10,Interviewer 2,"of how things were different in [REDACTED] than in [REDACTED], that's fine, just ",24
703,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,10,Interviewer 2,let us know. We're looking for kind of a region-wide perspective. I contacted you ,25
704,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,10,Interviewer 2,"because I knew about the [REDACTED] in [REDACTED], but sounds like you've got ",26
705,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,10,Interviewer 2,"some other relevant experience as a user, if nothing else, in other places.  ",27
706,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,11,Interviewee,"Sure. Right, and my wife's from [REDACTED], which has amazing water, and ",28
707,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,11,Interviewee,"they've had infrastructure for water and sewer for years, now. And I might be ",29
708,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,11,Interviewee,able to give you some insight there as well.  ,30
709,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,12,Interviewer 2,"Okay, sounds good. Let's see, so you touched on this a little bit. Can you tell me ",31
710,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,12,Interviewer 2,"about your educational and professional background? So like schooling, or how ",32
711,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,270,12,Interviewer 2,you got educated to do the things that you did with water infrastructure?  ,33
712,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,1,Interviewee,"Well, as far as water infrastructure, there wasn't much schooling other than on ",34
713,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,1,Interviewee,"the job. My highest level of education is [REDACTED], and I've been in ",35
714,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,1,Interviewee,"construction most of my life. Actually, I'm a plumber by trade. But Alaska seems ",36
715,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,1,Interviewee,"to be a lot different, being mainly boilers.  ",37
716,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,2,Interviewee,"When I took the job in [REDACTED] as a foreman, before that I was a water truck ",38
717,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,2,Interviewee,driver. I was also working in the mechanics department for a little bit. And you ,39
718,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,2,Interviewee,"learn a lot of rules and regulations just by that. So as a foreman, I was mostly ",40
719,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,2,Interviewee,"dealing with the logistical side of things, not so much like lagoons or anything else.  ",41
720,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,3,Interviewer 2,"Yeah, yeah. Well, this is actually, that's… This is great. You're the guy we want to ",42
721,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,3,Interviewer 2,"talk to, I think.  ",43
722,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,4,Interviewee,Okay.  ,44
723,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,5,Interviewer 2,"All right. So some of these questions, if you feel like they're repeats, don't worry ",45
724,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,5,Interviewer 2,"about it. I'm not trying to make you say the same thing over and over again, but ",46
725,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,5,Interviewer 2,if you feel like there's anything you have to add… So is that all the ways that ,47
726,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,5,Interviewer 2,"you've worked with water infrastructure? You were a driver, like so [REDACTED], ",48
727,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,5,Interviewer 2,"like, has drove a big delivery truck, right? And-  ",49
728,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,6,Interviewee,"Right. 3500-gallon water trucks. And with those, you just go house to house. ",50
729,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,6,Interviewee,"There's hookups plumbed outside for each house, and you hook your nozzle up ",51
730,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,6,Interviewee,to it and you just pump away. And currently how the system works is you have ,52
731,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,6,Interviewee,"tanks inside the house, and they could be multiple, plastic or single steel or ",53
732,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,6,Interviewee,"whatever they want. And when it gets to the point where it's full, there's an ",54
733,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,6,Interviewee,"overflow pipe where the water starts to pour out of that, which signals the driver ",55
734,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,6,Interviewee,to stop pumping.  ,56
735,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,7,Interviewer 2,"Unless the overflow's frozen, right?  ",57
736,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,8,Interviewee,"Well, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. That happens a lot. So that's actually a huge cost issue, ",58
737,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,8,Interviewee,"and it's a real big pain. And it's like, not only does it cost a lot of money to the ",59
738,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,8,Interviewee,"homeowner, but it also slows down services. So right now the way it's set up in ",60
739,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,8,Interviewee,"the city of [REDACTED]… And it's hard to find talent. Maybe not even, talent's not ",61
740,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,8,Interviewee,"the word, just people with CDLs. We're at the point now where you could have ",62
741,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,8,Interviewee,"your CDL one day and we're going to put you in a $250,000 truck and get you out ",63
742,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,8,Interviewee,"there working, because we need it. It's essential. ",64
743,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,9,Interviewee,"But like I said, back to it, it's very expensive. Replacing pipes, repairing flood ",65
744,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,9,Interviewee,damage. Most of the time the city of [REDACTED] not going to help you with the ,66
745,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,9,Interviewee,"cost of that. The verbiage in the contract sets them up to be pretty safe, for the ",67
746,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,271,9,Interviewee,"most part, being that if your pipes are frozen, we're not liable.  ",68
747,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"Secondly to that is, a lot of the drivers spend some time trying to clear these out. ",69
748,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"They actually do have a heart, where they could just walk away. They spend some ",70
749,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"time, which slows them down in getting to the next house. The average driver ",71
750,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"works between 8 and 10 hours a day on good times, and 14 to 15 for wintertime, ",72
751,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"just because it's slower to drive, the driveways are icy, the pipes are icy. And ",73
752,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"unfortunately, being an essential service and government, and due to the size of ",74
753,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"our town, [REDACTED], we're not subject to federal regulations for the FMCSA, I ",75
754,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,believe it is. Basically the Federal Motor Carrier's Association rules and ,76
755,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,regulations that dictate the amount of hours that a trucker can drive. Where ,77
756,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"normally it would be seven days, 70 hours, or eight days, 80 hours, or mileage. ",78
757,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"We're not subject to that in [REDACTED], so we just basically run our drivers to ",79
758,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,1,Interviewee,"the point where they don't want to work anymore, and then we try to find more.  ",80
759,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,2,Interviewer 2,And just to build on that piece a little bit about drivers having a heart or trying to ,81
760,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,2,Interviewer 2,"clear out the pipe, another thing that I've heard too is, or I've experienced, ",82
761,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,2,Interviewer 2,"actually, is that experienced drivers know about how much water should be going ",83
762,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,2,Interviewer 2,into a house. Sometimes the new ones don't. And so there's a difference between ,84
763,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,2,Interviewer 2,having your house flooded with an extra 50 gallons of water and having your ,85
764,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,2,Interviewer 2,house flooded with an extra 500 gallons of water. I've been on both of those. So ,86
765,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,2,Interviewer 2,that [crosstalk]-  ,87
766,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,3,Interviewee,"That's true. In fact, we just had a guy retire, [REDACTED], he's been with the city ",88
767,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,3,Interviewee,"for [REDACTED] years. And he knows, he'll learn. He knows, once a family stay in ",89
768,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,3,Interviewee,"their house for a very long time, and he knows every time he goes there, say, he ",90
769,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,3,Interviewee,"puts about 300 gallons in. So he knows that if it takes about 300 gallons, maybe ",91
770,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,3,Interviewee,"400, he's timing it. The pumps have variable speed, but he can get pretty close. ",92
771,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,3,Interviewee,"And so if he starts to go over that, he's thinking, ""Wait a minute, we might have ",93
772,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,3,Interviewee,"an issue."" So that's what… He's not going to flood you. He might shortchange you, ",94
773,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,3,Interviewee,but he's not going to flood you.  ,95
774,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,4,Interviewee,"Also a guy that, with that much experience could just listen to the tone that the ",96
775,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,4,Interviewee,"overflow pipe is putting out, and can get a sense of how full the tanks are. But ",97
776,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,4,Interviewee,"these new guys, they just don't have that skill. And they know it's an 800-gallon ",98
777,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,4,Interviewee,"tank, and they're not going to stop and think about anything until they get to ",99
778,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,4,Interviewee,1000. And it could've been overflowing from 600.  ,100
779,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,5,Interviewer 2,Can you walk us through kind of your day as a foreman?  ,101
780,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,6,Interviewee,"Sure. So a foreman, you try not to work when you're not working, but there's ",102
781,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,6,Interviewee,"parts of it that you are keeping in mind, like whether, as you drive to work, you're ",103
782,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,6,Interviewee,taking account of the road conditions. You're thinking about what you want to do ,104
783,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,6,Interviewee,"for a safety meeting, the subjects you want to cross. You're thinking about things ",105
784,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,6,Interviewee,"you need to address, whether it's safety-related or not, or if there's tension in the ",106
785,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,272,6,Interviewee,group and you want to just build your team up a little bit that day.  ,107
786,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"So you get to the office. And your route's already together, but you're starting to ",108
787,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,kind of see what you want to do. Like only once in the five years have I ever ,109
788,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"canceled a route in the morning, and it was just way too icy and dangerous. But ",110
789,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"basically you conduct your morning, you helped your guys do the walk-arounds. ",111
790,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"You deal with any issues, and there's always issues, there's always questions, and ",112
791,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"you got to be there for that. You assign trucks, help the new guys. Basically after ",113
792,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"you get your guys out the door in the morning, you start going through customer ",114
793,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"requests and extra calls, and you start just setting a pace for your day, getting ",115
794,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"kind of an idea of what it looks like. Do I have enough drivers to cover my routes, ",116
795,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,do I need to communicate that with the office? I could choose to say no extra ,117
796,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"calls, meaning that if you used up all your water before your next scheduled ",118
797,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"service, and you want more, I might just tell you you're not getting it. Which ",119
798,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"means you're toilet's going to fill up, unless you haul your own water. You're not ",120
799,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,"going to take a shower, you're not going to wash the dishes. And like I said, that ",121
800,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,1,Interviewee,all is based on what I got going on that day.  ,122
801,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,2,Interviewer 2,"Like capacity, you mean?  ",123
802,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,"Right. So 10 routes a day, most of this last year, I should say 12 months, because ",124
803,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,"we're kind of in-between years, I've had about nine drivers a day, so, that's ",125
804,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,"splitting a route. So if I have nine drivers with 10 routes a day, and I got one guy ",126
805,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,"calls in sick, now I really have an issue. So now, like I said, on a normal, good day, ",127
806,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,"my guys are working eight to 10 hours. Well now, we just bumped them up, now ",128
807,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,we're doing 14 hours. And I'm not going to ask these guys to do extra calls. I want ,129
808,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,"to get my commitment for this first. It's unfortunate, but the reasoning is the ",130
809,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,"customer really needs to… They live here, they know how it's going, they need to ",131
810,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,"manage the water a little better. It's not a very good excuse, it's kind of… I don't ",132
811,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,know the word [inaudible]. It's a poor excuse. I wish we were allowed to tell ,133
812,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,3,Interviewee,people that.  ,134
813,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,4,Interviewer 1,"And to follow up with that a little bit, how often do you get those calls with people ",135
814,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,4,Interviewer 1,asking you to come early?  ,136
815,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,5,Interviewee,Every day. Multiple.  ,137
816,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,6,Interviewer 1,Okay.  ,138
817,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,7,Interviewee,Yeah.  ,139
818,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,8,Interviewer 1,So pretty often.  ,140
819,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,9,Interviewee,Yeah. Anywhere from five to 25 requests. Especially when it's summertime and ,141
820,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,273,9,Interviewee,you got tugboats that want water.  ,142
821,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,1,Interviewer 1,"Yeah. And so when you're in that situation, would you say that you're mainly ",143
822,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,1,Interviewer 1,"limited by… It's typically having the available drivers, not really the equipment or ",144
823,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,1,Interviewer 1,water source issues or anything like that?  ,145
824,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,"It used to be that trucks were a factor. It used to be that, the city allowed their ",146
825,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,fleet to get so old that when they would break they would have a hard time ,147
826,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,finding replacement parts. And we would literally have drivers and no trucks. City ,148
827,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,"made a very good decision on upgrading their fleet, which has eliminated that ",149
828,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,part of our issue. Never have I had an issue with not enough water. Even during ,150
829,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,"large fires, we've always had enough water to service our community. So yeah, at ",151
830,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,"this point mainly it is just the drivers, being able to get ahold of them. And there's ",152
831,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,"a lot of reasons why we don't get drivers. So yeah, mostly just drivers at this point. ",153
832,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,"You have to just draw a line, you literally only have so much to work with. You ",154
833,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,"have a noise ordinance that starts at 10:00 PM, and we still have guys working ",155
834,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,"sometimes to 11:00 and 12:00 midnight just to get it done, just out of sense of ",156
835,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,"duty. You don't even ask these guys to work that much, there's just a sense of ",157
836,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,2,Interviewee,duty to their community that they want to get that finished. ,158
837,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,3,Interviewer 1,Wow.  ,159
838,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,4,Interviewer 2,"So, when people call, I mean, they call you, like you talk to people?  ",160
839,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,5,Interviewee,Yeah.  ,161
840,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,6,Interviewer 2,Yeah. And [crosstalk]-  ,162
841,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,7,Interviewee,"A lot of times. I try not to be the initial point of contact. I hired an assistant, which ",163
842,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,7,Interviewee,has been the first time since many foremen before me. Also they're encouraged ,164
843,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,7,Interviewee,to go through the office. But a lot of times they really don't have the up-to-date ,165
844,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,7,Interviewee,"information, and they can't really answer questions of people that are pretty ",166
845,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,7,Interviewee,"upset. I was pretty good at that, so I ended up talking to a few of them.  ",167
846,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,8,Interviewer 2,"Can you tell us a little bit about talking to people, talking to people about water ",168
847,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,8,Interviewer 2,"systems, explaining how things work? I mean, do you ever do that… I guess it's ",169
848,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,8,Interviewer 2,"probably one at a time, not so much public, but is that, that's part of your job too ",170
849,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,8,Interviewer 2,"I guess, huh?  ",171
850,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,9,Interviewee,"It is. And I've spoken to people, like to [REDACTED], people trying to get loans for ",172
851,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,9,Interviewee,"a house in [REDACTED], and they have no idea how it works out here. Newcomers ",173
852,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,9,Interviewee,"to [REDACTED], physically here, I'll go out and I'll walk through everything with ",174
853,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,9,Interviewee,them. We'll do some problem-solving with people who've been there their whole ,175
854,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,9,Interviewee,"lives, but their sewer tank was buried, and they don't know how big it is, or if it's ",176
855,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,9,Interviewee,leaking or if it's not. Mostly my interactions were with frustrated people who pay ,177
856,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,274,9,Interviewee,a lot of money for the service and are now not getting it. Because unfortunately ,178
857,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,1,Interviewee,"it wasn't just, ""I can't give you extra service,"" there's a lot of times where I can't ",179
858,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,1,Interviewee,give you the service that you're owed. We have a lot of upset people just for that.  ,180
859,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,2,Interviewer 2,"Did you have any follow-ups on that, [REDACTED]? All right. So how is drinking ",181
860,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,2,Interviewer 2,"water provided? So you've got the trucks, the other half of that… Like walk us ",182
861,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,2,Interviewer 2,"from the ground, how does water get to people's tap?  ",183
862,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,3,Interviewee,I'll do my best on that. I was never part of that system. That system is separate ,184
863,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,3,Interviewee,"from what I did. That's a whole nother thing. Now, you have to be a certified ",185
864,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,3,Interviewee,"water plant operator, and those names are public knowledge. For example, you ",186
865,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,3,Interviewee,could go look up [REDACTED] in the public Alaska registry as a water plant ,187
866,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,3,Interviewee,"operator. What they do is, I can't say exactly where, but they pick up ",188
867,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,3,Interviewee,"groundwater, I think there's some kind of well out there by [REDACTED]. ",189
868,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,4,Interviewer 2,There's-  ,190
869,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,5,Interviewee,"Yeah, [REDACTED]. They pick up the water that's non-potable, they add chlorine ",191
870,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,5,Interviewee,"and some other chemicals, they do multiple tests on it every hour, and they mix ",192
871,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,5,Interviewee,"the contents and they adjust the pH, and when they have an acceptable solution ",193
872,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,5,Interviewee,it goes into a holding tank where that is what's provided through the pipes and ,194
873,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,5,Interviewee,to the water trucks. But basically it starts as groundwater. You're not going to get ,195
874,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,5,Interviewee,"water, we don't ship water in or anything like that. It's just out of the ground.  ",196
875,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,6,Interviewer 2,How much of the water is through your shop and how much is through the pipes? ,197
876,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,6,Interviewer 2,"Like what's the split look like? Or how many houses do you do, I guess?  ",198
877,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,7,Interviewee,"Well, I figured out my last count that I do about [REDACTED] stops a week, with ",199
878,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,7,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] trucks. [REDACTED] water, and then I do it again with [REDACTED] ",200
879,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,7,Interviewee,"sewer. But those, some of those are repeat, some of those are not. So, I mean, ",201
880,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,7,Interviewee,"you're familiar with the area, others listening might not be. But basically, you got ",202
881,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,7,Interviewee,"all of [REDACTED], all of [REDACTED], you have all of [REDACTED]. Then you got ",203
882,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,7,Interviewee,[REDACTED]. So what that really means leftover is [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. ,204
883,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,7,Interviewee,"So I'd say two thirds of the water is delivered in [REDACTED]. So that's with, what, ",205
884,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,7,Interviewee,between [REDACTED] people?  ,206
885,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,8,Interviewer 2,"I have just a question that's not on the list, but I'm just curious based on your ",207
886,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,8,Interviewer 2,"experience. I was on piped water, or I was on hauled water and then I moved to ",208
887,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,8,Interviewer 2,"piped water. If you had to pick, or if you knew somebody, if [REDACTED] here was ",209
888,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,8,Interviewer 2,"moving to [REDACTED], what would you tell her about piped versus hauled ",210
889,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,8,Interviewer 2,water?  ,211
890,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,9,Interviewee,"I would say go hauled water. Hauled, hauled, hauled, hauled. Because the quality ",212
891,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,9,Interviewee,"is better, you're not relying on the age or condition of the pipes that are down ",213
892,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,9,Interviewee,"the line. Basically all that stuff that you cannot control in between the houses, the ",214
893,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,275,9,Interviewee,"main water supply line. Also, you can have a freeze down the line that's somebody ",215
894,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,1,Interviewee,"else's fault that impacts your house. Whereas hauled water, you're completely ",216
895,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,1,Interviewee,"on your own system. It's up to you to keep your pipes warm, and once you've got ",217
896,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,1,Interviewee,"a good system in place, you really never got to worry about it. And if you run out ",218
897,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,1,Interviewee,"of water, you could always go and fill your own, you can get some big garbage ",219
898,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,1,Interviewee,"cans and fill it up for quarters, and bring it to your house and pump it into your ",220
899,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,1,Interviewee,tank. Whereas if you're on pipe system… The only reason I say the quality of the ,221

901,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,1,Interviewee,"old days, I don't know if it's all poly pipe or if there's some metal pipe in there ",223

903,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,2,Interviewer 2,"I think [REDACTED] has got iron pipes, yeah.  ",225
904,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,3,Interviewee,"Yeah, see, we don't need that much iron in our diet.  ",226
905,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,4,Interviewer 2,"You talked a little bit about this, do you have any other sort of anecdotes about a ",227
906,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,4,Interviewer 2,challenge in local water infrastructure? You got any good stories for us about ,228
907,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,4,Interviewer 2,something breaking or having to solve a problem? Maybe? No?  ,229
908,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,5,Interviewee,We continue to grow with new technology and better design of our trucks. But ,230
909,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,5,Interviewee,we've come a long way. Water and sewer used to be done with giant wooden ,231
910,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,5,Interviewee,barrels on the back of flatbed pickups. We used to fill garbage cans. They used to ,232
911,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,5,Interviewee,"have these giant wooden barrels, and they would use a gas-powered Honda ",233
912,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,5,Interviewee,"pump, trash pump, and they would stick one into the barrel and then they'd fill ",234
913,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,5,Interviewee,"up your garbage can on your deck, and away we went. They used to take the ",235
914,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,5,Interviewee,"buckets out of your living room and walk out, try not to spill any on your living ",236
915,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,5,Interviewee,"room floor, and dump it into that other barrel. But these winters, when we're ",237
916,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,5,Interviewee,"driving truck, you got to drive out to [REDACTED].  ",238
917,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,"I guess one challenge I always thought was kind of cool was, it was a pain in the ",239
918,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,"butt, but it was unique to working so hard in the cold conditions is that you would ",240
919,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,"have to stop every mile or so and pump some water, because your entire line will ",241
920,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,"freeze. In the old days they used to stick the nozzle up by the exhaust stack, which ",242
921,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,I thought was horrible. That was before my time. But you would literally have an ,243
922,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,"inch and a quarter line that's 100 feet long frozen, and you would have to come ",244
923,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,"to the shop three, four times a day just to thaw out to go back out to do your ",245
924,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,"route. It's because of things like that, and it's not really an anecdote or anything, ",246
925,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,"but it's something that I thought was special, is that it takes some of the toughest ",247
926,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,men and women with the greatest amount of fortitude to continually get up and ,248
927,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,"do this job every day. It's absolutely brutal, it's freezing. You're literally standing ",249
928,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,out in the wind pumping water in -60 windchill up on a hill in [REDACTED] while ,250
929,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,276,6,Interviewee,you're so frozen you need to break the ice to bend your knee.  ,251
930,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,1,Interviewee,"And then you get in a truck for five minutes, you're already parked at the next ",252
931,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,1,Interviewee,"house, and you do it again. And you do that for 14 hours a day. I always admire ",253
932,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,1,Interviewee,the crew that works on water and sewer for that.  ,254
933,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,2,Interviewer 2,"Yeah. But sounds like it makes it hard to hire sometimes, too, huh?  ",255
934,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,3,Interviewee,"Well, it's, yeah, people know about it. They're scared of the work. A lot of young ",256
935,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,3,Interviewee,"guys I get that can't handle it. It's the old-timers that stay, it's the old veterans. ",257
936,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,3,Interviewee,"My crew… Or it's not my crew anymore, I guess, but my solid guys that work year-",258
937,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,3,Interviewee,"round that we've never had a problem with, that we always depended on. The ",259
938,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,3,Interviewee,only reason [REDACTED] has had the service they've had is because of men and ,260
939,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,3,Interviewee,women that were in their 50s. These are all people getting ready to retire. I've ,261
940,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,3,Interviewee,"hired big, strong kids, and they make it a week or two. And we continually go ",262
941,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,3,Interviewee,through them like that.  ,263
942,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,4,Interviewer 2,"So, there was a question here about seasonality of challenges, of infrastructure ",264
943,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,4,Interviewer 2,challenges. So it sounds like winter is the tough season.  ,265
944,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,5,Interviewee,"Yeah. Yeah, I think the guys would rather swat mosquitoes than freeze.  ",266
945,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,6,Interviewer 2,And you kind of hit on this a little bit about how challenges have changed over ,267
946,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,6,Interviewer 2,"time, so it's… Would you say that things have trended, trending better? Things ",268
947,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,6,Interviewer 2,are getting better?  ,269
948,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,They're trending better as far as SOP and mechanical. We're still in the same rut ,270
949,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,as far as consistently hiring employees to drive these trucks. There's too much ,271
950,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,"competition, there's a bad name for the work, there's too many hours. ",272
951,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] is a society where the dollar is not the value system. I mean, sure, ",273
952,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,"for some, we all have to make the money. But what's really valuable in ",274
953,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] is hunting, and sharing your food, and subsistence, and family. And ",275
954,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,that's what makes the place so special. So now you're asking these Native men ,276
955,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,"and women to come drive for me and I'm telling them, ""Nope, you can't moose ",277
956,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,"hunt, I don't got enough guys. Nope, you can't go fishing."" That's a big issue. So ",278
957,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,"you got to get guys from out of town, because they go for [REDACTED], they go ",279
958,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,for the other fueling guys. They're making more with those companies starting ,280
959,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,"out, they get two weeks on, two weeks off. Or they leave their family and they ",281
960,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,7,Interviewee,"come here to [REDACTED] and work, and they get a bunk house to stay in. ",282
961,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,8,Interviewee,"Here, you want to work for us, you better get a house, you better pay 1800 a ",283
962,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,8,Interviewee,"month. So who's going to leave [REDACTED], and it's beautiful here, and who's ",284
963,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,8,Interviewee,going to leave this to go be in [REDACTED] and pay exorbitant amounts for rent ,285
964,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,8,Interviewee,"and food for less possibilities in their life? So yeah, it is trending better in certain ",286
965,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,8,Interviewee,"ways, but you have one major issue that doesn't seem to be worked on. And I've ",287
966,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,277,8,Interviewee,begged and I've pleaded for it to the point where I just got red-faced and gave up.  ,288
967,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,1,Interviewer 2,What would help with that?  ,289
968,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"See, I've always been told eight different ways that I'm wrong, but I believe that ",290
969,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,a bunkhouse and a two weeks rotational shift would be hugely beneficial. I've ,291
970,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"been told that, ""If you're going to provide them with housing, I want housing. ",292
971,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"Even though I live here."" Or, ""I want extra money in my paycheck."" The city ",293
972,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,manager says the union won't allow it; the union says the city manager won't ,294
973,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"allow it. The public works director said, ""That's not going to happen."" I don't know ",295
974,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"any other way but to model ourselves after a more successful company, and I ",296
975,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"mean successful in staffing, not monetarily, but staffing. These other guys are full, ",297
976,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"and that's the one thing they all have in common is a bunkhouse. You come here, ",298
977,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"you work for two weeks, that's common in Alaska. You can go out to the slope all ",299
978,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,the time; you see guys doing that year after year. They're cool with that. Go spend ,300
979,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"some time with their family, come back here, work them to death. That's what ",301
980,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"they want to do, work them 12, 15 hours a day. Maybe you can keep the locals ",302
981,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,on a more regular schedule because you got these outsiders coming in to pick up ,303
982,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,2,Interviewee,"the slack, now you can have everybody going out and doing subsistence.  ",304
983,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,3,Interviewer 2,"Changing subject a little bit, are there any water quality challenges that you have?  ",305
984,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,4,Interviewee,"Not that I'm aware of. Like I said, yellow water. I mean, I know they do their tests, ",306
985,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,4,Interviewee,"I know they say that they're safe, but I don't know, the quality, I don't know. I ",307
986,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,4,Interviewee,don't know what you're going to do in [REDACTED] to improve quality. I know ,308
987,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,4,Interviewee,"that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]… Well, let's just leave [REDACTED] out of that, ",309
988,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,4,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] is, wow, their water quality is amazing. And I don't know how they're ",310
989,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,4,Interviewee,"doing it, but you could drink it straight out the tap, it's cold as ice, it tastes so ",311
990,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,4,Interviewee,"pure, and it's the best water I've literally had in my life. So if [REDACTED] could ",312
991,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,4,Interviewee,somehow model themselves after [REDACTED] that would probably be an ,313
992,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,4,Interviewee,improvement.  ,314
993,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,5,Interviewer 2,"So, some of these we hit on already, challenges due to arctic conditions, right?  ",315
994,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,6,Interviewee,Yeah.  ,316
995,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,7,Interviewer 2,"Times where you've had to be creative responding to challenges, and what you ",317
996,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,7,Interviewer 2,"would need, what would help. So I want to drill down on that one a little bit, when ",318
997,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,7,Interviewer 2,"you're talking about two on two off, I mean that also would be a package with ",319
998,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,7,Interviewer 2,"basically flying people in, right? I mean, it probably wouldn't be locals.  ",320
999,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,8,Interviewee,Right.  ,321
1000,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,9,Interviewer 2,"It would be more like [REDACTED] does with the bunkhouse. Or [REDACTED], ",322
1001,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,278,9,Interviewer 2,pilots.  ,323
1002,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, we'll probably have to be more like what the police are doing. I think they ",324
1003,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,1,Interviewee,"pay their own airfare, but the difference with those guys is that they work ",325
1004,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,1,Interviewee,"together. They're all mainly from [REDACTED], and they kind of know each other ",326
1005,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,1,Interviewee,"from the departments down there and they split rent. So it's very cheap out here, ",327
1006,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,1,Interviewee,"and you'll get two shifts, three or four guys splitting the one apartment. So it's a ",328
1007,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,1,Interviewee,little bit easier for them. But you're not going to find CDL drivers to actively do ,329
1008,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,1,Interviewee,"that, you would have to have somebody that organizes that.  ",330
1009,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,2,Interviewer 2,"So, I don't know if this is… Have you seen any impact of changing climate on the ",331
1010,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,2,Interviewer 2,ability to deliver water and water infrastructure?  ,332
1011,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,3,Interviewee,"Well, I don't know… We say we've noticed the changing climate, I mean, seems ",333
1012,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,3,Interviewee,"that the winters are growing to be more snow and less ice, lately, which does help ",334
1013,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,3,Interviewee,"with traction on the vehicles. Other than that, I couldn't really comment on it. The ",335
1014,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,3,Interviewee,"drawback with too much snow, of course, if you can't see the driveways, you get ",336
1015,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,3,Interviewee,stuck a lot. But at least you're not sliding off the road.  ,337
1016,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,4,Interviewer 2,"We had, a couple years ago we had that year where like, it rained the entire ",338
1017,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,4,Interviewer 2,"month of February, and the roads were disgusting. ",339
1018,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,5,Interviewee,Yes.  ,340
1019,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,6,Interviewer 2,That was a mess.  ,341
1020,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,7,Interviewee,"That was that one time that I canceled a route right away, that was the one and ",342
1021,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,7,Interviewee,only time was during that period.  ,343
1022,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,8,Interviewer 2,Yeah.  ,344
1023,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,9,Interviewee,It was out in [inaudible].  ,345
1024,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,10,Interviewer 2,"Yeah. But I guess in general, kind of warmer, wetter weather is better than colder, ",346
1025,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,10,Interviewer 2,colder weather. Colder weather.  ,347
1026,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,11,Interviewee,"It is for human beings and mechanical, for sure.  ",348
1027,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,12,Interviewer 2,"Yeah. So maybe you answered this already, but the water infrastructure challenge ",349
1028,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,12,Interviewer 2,"that you think is most important to fix, and if you could wave a magic wand and ",350
1029,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,12,Interviewer 2,"fix it, sounds like it's people, right?  ",351
1030,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,13,Interviewee,"If I had a magic wand? I mean, sure, more people if I wanted to fix the current ",352
1031,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,13,Interviewee,"conditions. But honestly, I would build another water plant, and I would pipe the ",353
1032,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,13,Interviewee,"entire city, and then I would work on replacing all of the oldest pipe.  ",354
1033,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,279,14,Interviewer 2,You think pipes are-  ,355
1034,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,1,Interviewee,And then try to keep-  ,356
1035,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,2,Interviewer 2,"Pipes are kind of the future, or the ideal goal?  ",357
1036,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,3,Interviewee,"That's the ideal goal. If I had a magic wand, trucks need to go away. They do. I ",358
1037,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,3,Interviewee,"mean, that's just a whole nother cost for the community. I mean, it's good for ",359
1038,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,3,Interviewee,"jobs, but they can pipe everything… You need to hire, take a lot of these water ",360
1039,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,3,Interviewee,truck drivers and put them on a different department to work on the pipes.  ,361
1040,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,4,Interviewer 2,Yeah.  ,362
1041,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,5,Interviewee,Yeah.  ,363
1042,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,6,Interviewer 2,"So, we talked a little bit about, so system failures from your end I guess would be ",364
1043,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,6,Interviewer 2,"times where you couldn't deliver water, or interruptions in services. You ",365
1044,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,6,Interviewer 2,"mentioned that, how often does that happen? I mean, I guess if I was a customer, ",366
1045,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,6,Interviewer 2,"and I got water delivered once a week, or was supposed to, how often would I ",367
1046,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,6,Interviewer 2,not get my water when I was supposed to?  ,368
1047,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,"Well, we try to keep in mind who was last, I don't know, skipped, I guess, ",369
1048,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,"intentionally skipped. We try to rotate the affected people. So with that in mind, ",370
1049,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,it just depends on the season and the amount of drivers I have. It could be at any ,371
1050,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,"point of the year, they could be in any season. It'd be hard to put a number on ",372
1051,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,"that. I would say no more than four times a year, which would be, as a whole, as ",373
1052,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,"a community, say, [REDACTED], skipped, a year. So I'd say no more than four ",374
1053,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,"times a year. So when I say, if I miss like, say, [REDACTED], say it's route four, I tell ",375
1054,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,"the route four guy to go help the route five guy, and then I have him cascade ",376
1055,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,"down the other routes to finish everybody off, we would make that a first priority ",377
1056,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,"the next morning. But to answer your question, I would say no more than four ",378
1057,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,7,Interviewee,times a year in any one spot.  ,379
1058,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,8,Interviewer 2,"Knowing that stuff, is there a priority for planning? Like what's the planning ",380

1060,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,"Pipe everybody. That way. Yeah. [REDACTED] Yeah, I know they want to be on a ",382
1061,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,water pipe. And I know that there's some other issues that they deal with right ,383
1062,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,now with [REDACTED] that they're working on. We need to have so many ,384
1063,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,"thousands of gallons on reserve for the school, as well as a higher capacity for ",385
1064,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,"what [REDACTED] is expected to use. Which is why I say another, a plant would ",386
1065,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,"be nice, another water filtration plant. Even right now if we had that, just for the ",387
1066,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,"trucks out in [REDACTED], that would be a life-saver. Because it's a 45 minute to ",388
1067,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,"one hour round-trip every time the trucks go empty. So if you can imagine, like in ",389
1068,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] you have 45 houses to do on your route, you could do between four ",390
1069,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,280,9,Interviewee,"and six, four and seven houses, but you got an hour round-trip to refill. I know ",391

1072,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,1,Interviewer 2,"because I think you've already answered them, but if there's anything that jumps ",394

1074,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,2,Interviewer 1,"Can I add a quick follow-up question too on that? So you kind of said, right, the ",396
1075,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,2,Interviewer 1,future is putting in piped everywhere. What are some kind of barriers for that ,397
1076,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,2,Interviewer 1,"happening? Is it funding, is it workforce considerations, kind of things like that?  ",398
1077,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,3,Interviewee,"I think it's always funding, it's always going to be funding. And I know we can find ",399
1078,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,3,Interviewee,"it. Yeah, so I don't know. And I also heard some rumor that there's some issues ",400

1080,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,3,Interviewee,"Apparently there's not too many people that make it. But I don't know, that's all ",402

1083,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,5,Interviewer 2,"Pivoting a little bit towards management, because you supervise people as a ",405
1084,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,5,Interviewer 2,"foreman, right? So there's some questions about what management challenges ",406

1086,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,5,Interviewer 2,"challenges, what you would need to better respond to these challenges. So those, ",408
1087,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,5,Interviewer 2,"I mean, I feel like you've kind of covered those, if there's any other thing that ",409
1088,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,5,Interviewer 2,jumps out at you to add.  ,410
1089,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,6,Interviewee,Sure. Took me a few years to realize it. At first I considered more what my city ,411
1090,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,6,Interviewee,"administration wanted of me, which was to crack the whip, push, squeeze them ",412
1091,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,6,Interviewee,"for all they were worth, just whip, whip, whip. And I grew up learning that a ",413
1092,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,6,Interviewee,"management, a boss shouldn't ask you to do things that they wouldn't do. So the ",414
1093,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,6,Interviewee,"hours they worked, the things they did, it began to be something that I wouldn't ",415
1094,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,6,Interviewee,do.  ,416
1095,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,So what I did was I emphasized more on my crew's happiness than I did the job. I ,417
1096,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,realize that my guys have a sense of community that no matter what I said to ,418
1097,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,"them, even if they were to be disobedient, it would be to get the job done. So, ",419
1098,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,"what I did is we had this saying that you work to live, you do not live to work. And ",420
1099,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,that means that this job should not be taking away from your happiness in life. So ,421
1100,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,"we made every effort to make sure that these guys had time off, even if we really, ",422
1101,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,really needed them. Sometimes guys would be wanting to work and you would ,423
1102,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,"tell them no, because it's their day off, and you know they need rest. We started ",424
1103,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,"caring more about the employee, and what happened was that you would have ",425
1104,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,"less internal conflict between the employees, you would have better production ",426
1105,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,7,Interviewee,"from the employees, and overall more positive attitude out of them.  ",427
1106,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,8,Interviewer 2,And you only employed people with CDL?  ,428
1107,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,281,9,Interviewee,Yep.  ,429
1108,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,1,Interviewer 2,"Okay. So you basically, that's the group of people that you're trying to hire. Did ",430
1109,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,1,Interviewer 2,"you ever hire somebody who said they were going to get a CDL, or was it just, ",431
1110,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,1,Interviewer 2,"""Once you get a CDL, come find me.""  ",432
1111,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,2,Interviewee,"We have, we have. In fact, there's been a loose system on that, we've actually ",433
1112,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,2,Interviewee,"hired people before they've even had their permits, just with the intent. We pay ",434
1113,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,2,Interviewee,"them full wages, we teach them how to drive, we get them their permit, and then ",435
1114,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,2,Interviewee,"we actually pay for them to get their CDL, take the test. We've actually sent ",436
1115,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,2,Interviewee,"people down to driving schools down this way towards [REDACTED], and had ",437
1116,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,2,Interviewee,"them do that. We've had some guys fail, we've had some guys kind of flake off, ",438
1117,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,2,Interviewee,"which has burdened the system a little bit. Because it's expensive, it's about ",439
1118,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,2,Interviewee,"$6,000 for school. But now I think where we last left off was if you show us the ",440
1119,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,2,Interviewee,"initiative, that you studied, and that you've got your permit, then we will hire you.  ",441
1120,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,3,Interviewee,And then we give you a time period.  ,442
1121,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,4,Interviewer 2,Can they work with a permit? I mean is that? ,443
1122,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,5,Interviewee,"They cannot drive our vehicles, but they could ride in the right seat and learn the ",444
1123,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,5,Interviewee,"job. They can see how it's done, we put them with an experienced driver. We'll ",445
1124,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,5,Interviewee,also give them time with like one of the streets and roads guys who would give ,446
1125,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,5,Interviewee,them some drive time in certain situations.  ,447
1126,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,6,Interviewer 2,"And they can learn how the pumps work and all that, the other part, right?  ",448
1127,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,7,Interviewee,"Yeah. In the meantime, they're getting trained up for what they're going to be ",449
1128,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,7,Interviewee,"doing, but also for their CDL.  ",450
1129,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,8,Interviewer 2,Okay.  ,451
1130,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,9,Interviewee,And a paycheck.  ,452
1131,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,10,Interviewer 1,"And kind of a follow-up on that, can you walk us through some of that initial ",453
1132,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,10,Interviewer 1,"training? So, say someone's just started, they have their license. How do they get ",454
1133,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,10,Interviewer 1,trained in terms of kind of actually working the pumps and the whole system? Is ,455
1134,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,10,Interviewer 1,"it just from kind of someone who's been there longer, is it more formalized ",456
1135,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,10,Interviewer 1,training?  ,457
1136,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,11,Interviewee,"It's not complicated. So, the biggest part is every morning you do a walk-around. ",458
1137,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,11,Interviewee,"So the experienced driver will show you the walk-around, there's, I know, loosely, ",459
1138,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,11,Interviewee,there's about 45 places that you search on the truck to make sure it's safe to drive. ,460
1139,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,11,Interviewee,"And you do that every morning. You either, you're told to do it, or you're ",461
1140,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,11,Interviewee,"explained how to do it. As far as the pumps go, 40 to 60 houses a day, you see it ",462
1141,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,282,11,Interviewee,"turned on and turned off that many times every single day, you'll pick it up.  ",463
1142,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,1,Interviewer 2,"[REDACTED] Well, I have a question. So do you feel like, is the CDL, is that useful ",464
1143,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,1,Interviewer 2,information? Or is that kind of jumping through hoops? Like could you do on the ,465
1144,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,1,Interviewer 2,"job training, could you teach that stuff? Or is the time people spend doing CDL, is ",466
1145,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,1,Interviewer 2,that really very valuable for the job they're going to be doing?  ,467
1146,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,2,Interviewee,"It depends. I mean, I honestly, I prefer to teach guys myself when they come in ",468
1147,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,2,Interviewee,"with an idea. Unless they're really experienced, and if they come in kind of ",469
1148,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,2,Interviewee,"halfway experienced, that could be dangerous if they have too much confidence. ",470
1149,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,2,Interviewee,"There's no replacement for experience. So I guess with that said, if you don't have ",471
1150,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,2,Interviewee,"a lot of it, I'd prefer to train them. But it doesn't take a lot to get your license.  ",472
1151,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,3,Interviewer 2,"Do you think your situation would be… I mean, you're only hiring people with a ",473
1152,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,3,Interviewer 2,"CDL because you have to, right? So if we could wave a wand and say that's not ",474
1153,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,3,Interviewer 2,"the rule anymore, you can hire whoever you want, would you still hire people ",475
1154,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,3,Interviewer 2,"with a CDL, or would you, how would you value that?  ",476
1155,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"No, no. I would hire anybody that can drive, man. And that's how it used to be. ",477
1156,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] used to be where you could, it was off-highway, it was exempt. And ",478
1157,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"we had full crews, all the time. This was back when they had 25 people, they had ",479
1158,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,25 drivers for less than a city. Could you imagine? These guys were getting done ,480
1159,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"in six hours. They would all drive back to the shop and have coffee breaks, and ",481
1160,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"then they'd go back on the road, finish the route, and clean the shop for a couple ",482
1161,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"hours. Now there's only a roster of 15 positions allowed. [REDACTED] Yeah, so ",483
1162,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"now there's only 15 positions, and it's so tight, and we still can't fill those. And ",484
1163,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"that's why we lost them, is because they got tired of allocating money every year ",485
1164,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"for positions that would never be filled. Take away that CDL garbage, it's just a ",486
1165,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,4,Interviewee,"piece of paper, and we would have no problems with these trucks.  ",487
1166,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,5,Interviewer 2,What changed? ,488
1167,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,6,Interviewee,"The DOT. They said, ""Well, hold on, it's a city, that's a highway right there, you ",489
1168,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,6,Interviewee,can't be driving these trucks on a highway without a CDL in the middle of ,490

1170,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,6,Interviewee,"A certificate doesn't change anything. You have a knack for it, you can do it or you ",492
1171,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,6,Interviewee,"can't do it. I mean, I suppose if you're a microbiologist, yeah, you should probably ",493
1172,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,6,Interviewee,"go to school. But this isn't that, this is driving a large Subaru. You just turn a little ",494
1173,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,6,Interviewee,"later. There's some things you got to learn about air breaks. Okay, we can teach ",495
1174,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,6,Interviewee,that.  ,496
1175,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,7,Interviewer 2,You said there's been some people you've tried to put through training and ,497
1176,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,7,Interviewer 2,they've kind of flaked out or whatever. Are there challenges… You said it wasn't ,498
1177,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,7,Interviewer 2,"that hard to get a CDL. Have you had people that just kind of can't do it? I mean, ",499
1178,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,7,Interviewer 2,"has that been a barrier? And if it is a barrier, is it a barrier that people can't do it, ",500
1179,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,283,7,Interviewer 2,or because they just kind of don't want to?  ,501
1180,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,1,Interviewee,They don't want to. It's the whole you can lead a horse to water thing. They're ,502
1181,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,1,Interviewee,just not ambitious.  ,503
1182,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,2,Interviewer 2,"But not, it's not an issue of just… I don't know the test, so I'm speaking out of ",504
1183,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,2,Interviewer 2,"ignorance here, but-  ",505
1184,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,3,Interviewee,It's not a cognitive issue.  ,506
1185,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,4,Interviewer 2,"Is it reading, or? ",507
1186,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,5,Interviewee,"I mean, I think it's like a 75-question test for the main part, and it's mostly ",508
1187,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,5,Interviewee,"common sense, and then it's a driving test. And if you can't drive a truck with a ",509
1188,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,5,Interviewee,"manual transmission, then that's, they mark that on your license, and big deal, ",510
1189,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,5,Interviewee,"we have all automatics. If you can't drive a combination, with a tractor trailer, ",511
1190,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,5,Interviewee,"then you get a class B license, which is still fine, you just only drive stick truck. And ",512
1191,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,5,Interviewee,then there's an additional test that's only 25 questions so you get your tanker ,513
1192,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,5,Interviewee,"endorsement, which is required, but only 25 questions. So we're talking 100 ",514

1194,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,6,Interviewer 1,"But you said it's expensive for the test, correct? So that could be a barrier is the ",516
1195,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,6,Interviewer 1,price?  ,517
1196,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,7,Interviewee,"It is, if you're not motivated. I mean, if you go to the job center there in ",518
1197,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,7,Interviewee,"[REDACTED], plenty of guys get it waived. The government will fund you for that. ",519

1200,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,7,Interviewee,then you have to show why the field that you're wanting to get into has a future. ,522
1201,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,7,Interviewee,So part of that is… I went through it myself; I got my CDL for free. And part of it ,523

1207,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 16 ,284,9,Interviewee,"No, no, just kind of like a liaison sometimes. Like where, ""Yeah, I understand you ",529

1272,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,6,Interviewee,"much of that was on water. So, how do we get water to people, how do we help people ",8
1273,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,6,Interviewee,"be healthy with the water that they have, and how do we help the people out in ",9

1276,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,7,Interviewer 1, But you're doing something a little different. Are you still doing any water stuff? ,12
1277,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,8,Interviewee,"Very little. [REDACTED] so very little of what I do now is directly related to water, but I do ",13

1279,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,9,Interviewer 1, Okay. Can you say a little bit more about the ways that you worked with water ,15
1280,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,10,Interviewer 1,infrastructure and who you worked with? ,16
1281,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,11,Interviewee,Sure. I worked for [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] an environmental health services program. ,17
1282,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,11,Interviewee,"We worked with [REDACTED] villages in the region to help them run water systems, ",18

1284,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,12,Interviewer 1," Okay. So some of these questions are going to be specific about a utility, but you've had ",20
1285,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,13,Interviewer 1,"experience working… I mean, you have your community in [REDACTED], as well as a bunch ",21
1286,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,13,Interviewer 1,"of other communities, so the answers might vary. ",22
1287,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,14,Interviewee,Sure. ,23
1288,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,15,Interviewer 1," And just, I guess, describe that as you go. How is drinking water provided in your area? ",24
1289,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,16,Interviewee,"Sure. In my community, where I live, [REDACTED], we have a combination of piped water ",25
1290,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,16,Interviewee,provided to [REDACTED] subdivisions or neighborhoods in town. All of the rest of the ,26
1291,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,16,Interviewee,"community is served by a vehicle haul system, so trucks deliver potable water to the ",27
1292,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,16,Interviewee,home. They're delivered to tanks in the home. ,28
1293,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,287,17,Interviewer 1," And if we thought about your area as broader, right? ",29
1294,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,1,Interviewee,"Bigger than that, yeah. So I consider the [REDACTED] region my area, since I have worked ",30
1295,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,1,Interviewee,with a service provider in the region for a number of years. So we have a combination. ,31
1296,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,1,Interviewee,"We have some communities with no service, so people haul water themselves from ",32
1297,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,1,Interviewee,natural water sources to their homes. We have communities that are served with what ,33
1298,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,1,Interviewee,we call small vehicle haul systems. So 100 gallons of water is transported in a tank behind ,34
1299,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,1,Interviewee,an ATV or a snowmachine and delivered to the home. And then we have some ,35
1300,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,1,Interviewee,"communities and homes, of course, that have piped water.  ",36
1301,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,2,Interviewer 1, And how is the water treated?  ,37
1302,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,3,Interviewee,"Sure. So, well, we have groundwater and surface water, but almost all of the communities ",38
1303,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,3,Interviewee,"in the region do have a water treatment plant. So, with very few exceptions, almost every ",39
1304,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,3,Interviewee,community in my part of Alaska has a water treatment plant with a way to provide treated ,40
1305,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,3,Interviewee,"water to community members. So all the usual. We have filters and chlorination, is usually ",41
1306,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,3,Interviewee,what we see. Mix of filtration types.  ,42
1307,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,4,Interviewer 1," So, you mentioned this before, about your role. So your current a role is something a little ",43
1308,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,5,Interviewer 1,"bit different, but you explained what you did before that with relation to water, so I don't ",44
1309,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,5,Interviewer 1,"think we probably need to revisit that. What was your previous role? We've got that. So, ",45
1310,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,5,Interviewer 1,"if we're looking at before the job you have now, when you were working with water ",46
1311,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,5,Interviewer 1,"regularly, what were your main responsibilities? And can you walk us through a daily or a ",47
1312,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,5,Interviewer 1,weekly routine?  ,48
1313,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,6,Interviewee,"Sure. Yeah. I mentioned [REDACTED], so that was certainly a weekly duty. [REDACTED]. ",49
1314,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,6,Interviewee,We do a coliform testing there [REDACTED]. I also mentioned water plant operator ,50
1315,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,6,Interviewee,"training. [REDACTED], mostly in-person at the time, classroom trainings to water plant ",51
1316,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,6,Interviewee,"operators at the villages and communities around the region. [REDACTED], which has ",52
1317,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,6,Interviewee,been a program in Alaska for many years. [REDACTED] great guys there in that program ,53
1318,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,6,Interviewee,that provide onsite assistance and technical assistance to the water plant operators. ,54
1319,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,6,Interviewee,[REDACTED] environmental health staff likewise provided onsite assistance and some ,55
1320,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,6,Interviewee,"technical assistance by phone. So, if we had a community with questions about ",56
1321,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,6,Interviewee,"regulations, or water sampling requirements, or getting a sanitary survey, [REDACTED]. ",57
1322,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,7,Interviewer 1," Okay. So, based on what you said, you were talking regularly with water plant operators. ",58
1323,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,8,Interviewer 1,"Did you talk with community members about water, ever?  ",59
1324,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,9,Interviewee,Sometimes. Usually it was more the city offices or tribal offices that would manage the ,60
1325,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,9,Interviewee,water plants. So we often talked with water plant operators. We often talked with utility ,61
1326,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,9,Interviewee,"managers or city managers that were involved with the water system. Occasionally, ",62
1327,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,9,Interviewee,community members. Sometimes we would get complaints or concerns or questions ,63
1328,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,9,Interviewee,"about testing, and we would do as much as we could in terms of community education.  ",64
1329,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,10,Interviewer 1," Okay, so can you give an example of what that might have looked like, or a time that you ",65
1330,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,288,11,Interviewer 1,did it?  ,66
1331,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,1,Interviewee,"Sure, like community meetings, [REDACTED] community meetings when there were ",67
1332,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,1,Interviewee,"concerns about the water quality. When cities were looking at changing rates, there ",68
1333,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,1,Interviewee,would often be community meetings to discuss those changes. We would participate in ,69
1334,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,1,Interviewee,"those. Certainly when [REDACTED], community meetings, and sometimes debates were ",70
1335,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,1,Interviewee,a part of that as well.  ,71
1336,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,2,Interviewer 1, Okay. Do you have a feeling or description of how you like to talk to people about water ,72
1337,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,3,Interviewer 1,in those situations? What does that look like?  ,73
1338,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,4,Interviewee,"Yeah, I- ",74
1339,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,5,Interviewer 1," About water systems, I guess, yeah.  ",75
1340,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,6,Interviewee,"Sure. Yeah. I'm pro-treated water, and I think coming from this region, sometimes people ",76
1341,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,6,Interviewee,"in the region prefer untreated, natural sources of water. There's a theme that something ",77
1342,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,6,Interviewee,"that's natural is good for us, right? So if we're picking ice and we're using that water, that's ",78
1343,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,6,Interviewee,better for us. It's more natural. That's what our elders did. So I usually have to take the ,79
1344,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,6,Interviewee,"stance of explaining why treated water, why we know it's safe and healthy for us. So that's ",80
1345,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,6,Interviewee,"usually the end that I felt like I was always on, is trying to explain why treated water is ",81
1346,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,6,Interviewee,"good, it's healthy for us, why it's important to use that.  ",82
1347,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,7,Interviewer 1, Okay.  ,83
1348,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,8,Interviewee,"I don't know if that answered your question, I'm sorry.  ",84
1349,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,9,Interviewer 1," Yeah, I think so. So you went over a little bit, who you usually worked with, and mostly it ",85
1350,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,10,Interviewer 1,"was, it sounds like, city office- ",86
1351,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,11,Interviewee,Operations.  ,87
1352,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,12,Interviewer 1," Operators, and occasionally it was the lay public. Is that? ",88
1353,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,13,Interviewee,Yes.  ,89
1354,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,14,Interviewer 1, Okay. Very good. Okay. So those are some introductory questions. I'm going to just take ,90
1355,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,15,Interviewer 1,a pause and ask [REDACTED] if there's anything else [crosstalk].  ,91
1356,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,16,Interviewer 2," Yeah, no, that was great. Yeah. I have a follow-up question. We talked about ",92
1357,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,17,Interviewer 2,communicating with the public about water quality or water systems. How did you ,93
1358,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,17,Interviewer 2,"typically communicate with operators, and maybe were there challenges there, especially ",94
1359,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,17,Interviewer 2,when you were talking about the [REDACTED] you were involved in? ,95
1360,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,18,Interviewee,"Yeah, lots of challenges. Thank you very much, [REDACTED]. I feel like you get me. Yeah, ",96
1361,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,289,18,Interviewee,"so water plant operators, not to generalize and stereotype, but I totally will, they're a ",97
1362,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,1,Interviewee,bunch of great old dudes that work in their communities. They don't always use ,98
1363,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,1,Interviewee,smartphones. They can sometimes be difficult to get a hold of.  ,99
1364,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,2,Interviewee,"So, believe it or not, we still used a fax. Water plant operators were really good at faxing ",100
1365,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,2,Interviewee,"stuff. We could reach them on the phone during their work hours at the water plant, but ",101
1366,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,2,Interviewee,"it's an old-school crowd, so we did a lot of work… Outreach with phone. We certainly did ",102
1367,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,2,Interviewee,in-person work when we were there in the communities. We'd spend as much time as ,103
1368,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,2,Interviewee,"possible as we could with the water plant operators. But yeah, it certainly has its ",104
1369,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,2,Interviewee,challenges.  ,105
1370,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,3,Interviewer 2," Yeah, and was that even… So you mentioned you were involved in multiple aspects, ",106
1371,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,4,Interviewer 2,"including training as well. Was that kind of interaction different, when you were ",107
1372,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,4,Interviewer 2,specifically working on operator training?  ,108
1373,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,5,Interviewee,"Yeah, it's highly variable. We have a… If you look at the age curve of the water plant ",109
1374,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,5,Interviewee,"operators in the region, it's certainly more on one side. So we have found over the years ",110
1375,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,5,Interviewee,that in-person classroom trainings tends to work the best for people. During the ,111
1376,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,5,Interviewee,"pandemic, we've been trying some alternate methods of training, and then the age of ",112
1377,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,5,Interviewee,participants for that looks very different. So we do find that the next generation of water ,113
1378,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,5,Interviewee,plant operators is certainly more interested in and available to do texting and maybe apps ,114
1379,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,5,Interviewee,"and maybe some Zoom stuff. But yeah, it's an old school crowd overall.  ",115
1380,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,6,Interviewer 2," Yeah, definitely. Okay, great. Thank you. I'll pipe in a little bit more going forward, too, ",116
1381,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,7,Interviewer 2,"but for the introductory, I think those are the questions I have right now.  ",117
1382,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,8,Interviewer 1," Yeah. Yeah, it's weird because I've heard these stories before. Okay, well, so moving ",118
1383,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,9,Interviewer 1,forward and talk a little bit about general water infrastructure and your experiences or ,119
1384,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,9,Interviewer 1,"impressions of that. And again, this would be, I guess, either in your community or the ",120
1385,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,9,Interviewer 1,communities you worked. So we're going to start by just asking if there's a recent moment ,121
1386,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,9,Interviewer 1,"or a story that made you aware of challenges in local water infrastructure, an anecdote.  ",122
1387,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,10,Interviewee,"Can't think of a recent moment that it occurred to me that there were challenges, but I ",123
1388,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,10,Interviewee,came into this field wanting to better understand the challenges. One of the first ,124
1389,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,10,Interviewee,"communities that I worked with in the region was a community called [REDACTED], and ",125
1390,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,10,Interviewee,"they were trying to get a piped water system for the first time, and really struggling to ",126
1391,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,10,Interviewee,"meet some of the, what we call capacity indicators. Are you…? Through the [REDACTED] ",127
1392,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,10,Interviewee,"program, [REDACTED]? I don't know if that rings…? I know, [REDACTED] you're familiar ",128
1393,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,10,Interviewee,with that. ,129
1394,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,11,Interviewer 1," That's both… Some of those are administrative, and some of them more like- ",130
1395,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,12,Interviewee,"Operations, yeah.  ",131
1396,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,290,13,Interviewer 1," Yeah, operations, right?  ",132
1397,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. Yes, correct. Okay, so I guess I was just thinking of that community because when I ",133
1398,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,1,Interviewee,"was working directly with that community, they were working through some of the ",134
1399,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,1,Interviewee,"administrative hurdles to score out and qualify to get a piped water project, which they ",135
1400,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,1,Interviewee,were eventually able to do. And then there was the whole operations piece as they got ,136
1401,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,1,Interviewee,"funding and built a new water plant, and it replaced the old plant, and worked closely ",137
1402,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,1,Interviewee,with operator training and got them trained on the new plant.  ,138
1403,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,2,Interviewee,And then the project was… The distribution system was completed only at 50%. So half of ,139
1404,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,2,Interviewee,"the community had a complete distribution system, and the other part of the community, ",140
1405,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,2,Interviewee,"the distribution system was not completed for a number of years, and that was just ",141
1406,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,2,Interviewee,"completed this year, and that's like a decade later.  ",142
1407,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,3,Interviewee,So I guess I highlighted that example because it's one of the most interesting and ,143
1408,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,3,Interviewee,"frustrating community case studies that I worked with, and I started working with that ",144
1409,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,3,Interviewee,"community on the ground, in person, in like [REDACTED], helping them get ready to get a ",145
1410,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,3,Interviewee,"piped system, and that just was completed [REDACTED].  ",146
1411,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,4,Interviewer 1," Great. Along the same lines, can you think of any recent examples of infrastructure issues ",147
1412,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,5,Interviewer 1,"at your own house, with lead, and public works?  ",148
1413,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,6,Interviewee,"Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Yes, absolutely.  ",149
1414,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,7,Interviewer 1, [crosstalk] question.  ,150
1415,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,8,Interviewee,"So in the community in which I live [REDACTED], we had some lead exceedances in recent ",151
1416,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,8,Interviewee,"years, and there was virtually no follow-up on the part of our operations team.  ",152
1417,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,9,Interviewee,So when you have lead exceedances and you don't do the required resampling or any of ,153
1418,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,9,Interviewee,"the public notifications, you then find yourself in a regulatory situation. So I certainly tried ",154
1419,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,9,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] to help the community operations staff get out of that, with limited success.  ",155
1420,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,10,Interviewer 1," It got fixed, right?  ",156
1421,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,11,Interviewee,"I haven't checked recently, but yeah, we did get some things resolved at the time.  ",157
1422,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,12,Interviewer 1," All right. Well, according to the consumer confidence report [inaudible].  ",158
1423,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,13,Interviewee,It's fixed this year.  ,159
1424,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,14,Interviewer 1," Okay, great. Sorry. All right. So, what water infrastructure challenges does your ",160
1425,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,15,Interviewer 1,community face? And that could be about water quality or the physical infrastructure.  ,161
1426,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,16,Interviewee,I think distribution systems in the Arctic are probably more challenging than anything else. ,162
1427,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,16,Interviewee,So I certainly think about distribution systems. There's a big difference in the communities ,163
1428,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,291,16,Interviewee,that we work with that have a centralized treatment plant and what we call a watering ,164
1429,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,1,Interviewee,"point where people go there to get the treated water and take it to their homes. So, ",165
1430,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,1,Interviewee,"picture that, much simpler system, than the same water plant in a different community ",166
1431,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,1,Interviewee,with pipes running through the frozen arctic permafrost to [REDACTED] homes.  ,167
1432,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,2,Interviewee,"So, first off, I would say distribution systems. They're just tough to run in Arctic Alaska. ",168
1433,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,2,Interviewee,"Second of all, and this is not directly related to infrastructure, but I would say managerial ",169
1434,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,2,Interviewee,"infrastructure. So, many of our communities, we have one or two water plant operators. ",170
1435,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,2,Interviewee,We have high turnover. We may have little to no oversight… Wide range of managerial ,171
1436,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,2,Interviewee,"oversight and knowledge about operations, and that is a constant struck. So, number one, ",172
1437,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,2,Interviewee,"distribution systems in general. Number two, managerial capacity.  ",173
1438,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,3,Interviewer 1, And what do you see as community impacts related to those challenges?  ,174
1439,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,4,Interviewee,"So, speaking to the distribution system, when you have a community with a distribution ",175
1440,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,4,Interviewee,"system and it is not properly run, you end up with freezes. You have homes with no ",176
1441,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,4,Interviewee,"service. Sometimes that affects the loop, so then we have lots of homes with no service. ",177
1442,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,4,Interviewee,You then are not collecting revenue because you have houses that are not receiving ,178
1443,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,4,Interviewee,"service, and you can have lasting impacts to the distribution system. And then for the ",179
1444,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,4,Interviewee,"managerial piece that I mentioned, like operator turnover and support and recruiting, I ",180
1445,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,4,Interviewee,"think that's the biggest concern that I have. And then of course, the financial piece, it's, ",181
1446,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,4,Interviewee,"you have to have managerial support and capacity to run a water system like a business, ",182
1447,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,4,Interviewee,"to get your revenue, cover your expenses.  ",183
1448,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,5,Interviewer 1," Yeah, so the next question has to do with… Is asking whether those challenges change ",184
1449,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,6,Interviewer 1,"throughout the year, like seasonally. I mean, I think I can probably guess for freeze-ups, ",185
1450,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,6,Interviewer 1,"but I'd be interested to know, for all the things you listed, if there's a seasonality to that.  ",186
1451,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,7,Interviewee,"Yeah, I think so. So, like you said, it's hard to run distribution systems when it's very, very ",187
1452,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,7,Interviewee,"cold out. So, for sure, there. It's also more expensive to run water plants when it's really ",188
1453,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,7,Interviewee,"cold out and you're heating everything. So our costs go up, right? Just keeping a water ",189
1454,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,7,Interviewee,"plant heated, keeping the distribution system heated. I would say seasonally, we have ",190
1455,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,7,Interviewee,"operators that will take subsistence leave, so sometimes summer times can be hard to ",191
1456,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,7,Interviewee,"find someone around to run the water plant, too, because of fishing and subsistence ",192
1457,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,7,Interviewee,leave. So there is a seasonality to it.  ,193
1458,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,8,Interviewer 1," So, fishing would be like summertime?  ",194
1459,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,9,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.  ,195
1460,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,10,Interviewer 1," Okay, so challenges in the winter from freezing and cold conditions. Potentially also ",196
1461,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,11,Interviewer 1,challenges- ,197
1462,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,12,Interviewee,Subsistence practices. It's sometimes hard to find someone to check on the water plant if ,198
1463,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,12,Interviewee,you have one or two people employed to do that and you've got people out for moose ,199
1464,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,292,12,Interviewee,hunting or fishing.  ,200
1465,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,1,Interviewer 1," Very good. So, next question is about water quality. Do you face water quality challenges?  ",201
1466,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,2,Interviewer 2," And before we move on, I'm going to ask one question on the same topic. Do you notice ",202
1467,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,3,Interviewer 2,that there's intermittent supply issues as well? Or is that really just maybe due to a freeze-,203
1468,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,3,Interviewer 2,up that would cause a service disruption?  ,204
1469,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,4,Interviewee,"Yeah, definitely, we have intermittent supply issues. I'm thinking of a couple of ",205
1470,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,4,Interviewee,"communities where they have to move their intake each spring and fall, especially surface ",206
1471,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,4,Interviewee,"water systems, like [REDACTED] is an example that comes to mind. So they have to ",207
1472,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,4,Interviewee,remove their river intake entirely during freeze-up each spring and during break-up each ,208
1473,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,4,Interviewee,fall. So we have these awkward seasons during break-up and freeze-up where we have ,209
1474,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,4,Interviewee,virtually no supply because we had to pull the supply to switch over to the next season.  ,210
1475,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,5,Interviewer 2, Interesting.  ,211
1476,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,6,Interviewee,"We also have, not that many anymore, when I started we had a lot of them, but systems ",212
1477,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,6,Interviewee,that we call like fill-and-draw systems. Do you know what that means?  ,213
1478,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,7,Interviewer 2, I [crosstalk].  ,214
1479,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,8,Interviewee,"Where we pump water seasonally, right? So we pump water in the unfrozen part of the ",215
1480,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,8,Interviewee,"year, we fill up a giant water tank, and we try to make that last as long as we can. But ",216
1481,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,8,Interviewee,there's not that many of those systems that rely entirely on fill-and-draw any longer.  ,217
1482,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,9,Interviewer 2, Okay.  ,218
1483,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,10,Interviewee,"So yes, lots of intermittent challenges.  ",219
1484,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,11,Interviewer 1," Do you remember where… Was it somewhere out on [REDACTED], or was it [crosstalk]?  ",220
1485,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,12,Interviewee,[REDACTED].  ,221
1486,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,13,Interviewer 1," Oh, was it [REDACTED] that was doing that? It seems like that was recurrent problem year ",222
1487,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,14,Interviewer 1,after year [crosstalk]- ,223
1488,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,15,Interviewee,"Yep, every single year.  ",224
1489,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,16,Interviewer 1," Like the end of the winter, they would just be out of water.  ",225
1490,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,17,Interviewee,"Absolutely, yep, for months.  ",226
1491,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,18,Interviewer 1, Great. Okay.  ,227
1492,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,293,19,Interviewee,Yeah. What's up with water quality? Remind me of the question.  ,228
1493,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,1,Interviewer 1," Yeah, moving onto, do you have water quality issues as well?  ",229
1494,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,2,Interviewee,"Yeah, we do. Thank you for asking. Yeah, so… Oh, [REDACTED], you'd mentioned about ",230
1495,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,2,Interviewee,intermittent access. We have weird seasonal fluctuations in source water quality. I ,231
1496,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,2,Interviewee,"mentioned that community of [REDACTED] where we have a surface water intake, and ",232
1497,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,2,Interviewee,"how we literally have to pull it out in the freeze-up, and break-up is what we call… Sorry, ",233
1498,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,2,Interviewee,"I forget sometimes when I'm talking to non-Alaskans, when the river… Break-up is just ",234
1499,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,2,Interviewee,"what it sounds like if you're imagining an icy river. So, yeah. Our source water changes ",235
1500,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,2,Interviewee,"pretty dramatically during those times of year. So, yes, water quality can be challenging ",236
1501,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,2,Interviewee,when your source water quality is changing seasonally or from other reasons. After ,237
1502,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,2,Interviewee,"flooding, et cetera.  ",238
1503,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,3,Interviewer 1, Is source water quality the primary driver of water quality issues?  ,239
1504,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,4,Interviewee,No.  ,240
1505,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,5,Interviewer 1, Okay.  ,241
1506,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,6,Interviewee,"No, but it is like a legitimate challenge. So, especially, I think, for some of our less ",242
1507,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,6,Interviewee,"experienced operators, they might work really closely with the Remote Maintenance ",243
1508,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,6,Interviewee,"Worker Program that we talked about to dial in a treatment system, right? But they're ",244
1509,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,6,Interviewee,"not always able to adjust the treatment system as needed, right?  ",245
1510,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,7,Interviewee,"So the design engineers come in, they set it, the RMWs help train the operators, they ",246
1511,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,7,Interviewee,"might make some tweaks, but when you have source water quality that's changing for ",247
1512,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,7,Interviewee,"whatever reason, or other changes that need to be made, I don't always feel that the ",248
1513,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,7,Interviewee,operators are able to make those adjustments as they should.  ,249
1514,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,8,Interviewee,And that actually came up with [REDACTED] as well. The water treatment plant is just set ,250
1515,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,8,Interviewee,"on basic parameters, and so our design is set to treat it in this very specific way. And when ",251
1516,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,8,Interviewee,"the needs change, we don't always have operators that can adjust the treatment as ",252
1517,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,8,Interviewee,needed so that you continue having high-quality water. So I do see that coming up a lot.  ,253
1518,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,9,Interviewer 1," Yeah, so when they added another piped loop and they were making twice as much ",254
1519,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,10,Interviewer 1,water- ,255
1520,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,11,Interviewee,"Yes, and they didn't… Yeah, exactly. Very good, very good example. I was struggling to ",256
1521,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,11,Interviewee,think of an example.  ,257
1522,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,12,Interviewer 1," I think the temperature, maintaining… They change the water temperature, too.  ",258
1523,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,13,Interviewee,"Temperature, yep.  ",259
1524,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,294,14,Interviewer 1, Okay. Is it difficult to meet regulatory requirements?  ,260
1525,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. Yes, sometimes, especially when we have, I think less experienced operators, just ",261
1526,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,1,Interviewee,"knowledge gaps. I mean, people say… Yeah, I think the lead and copper thing that came ",262
1527,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,1,Interviewee,up with city of [REDACTED] recently. I should explain that the [REDACTED] water system ,263
1528,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,1,Interviewee,"is… We had a level [REDACTED] operator for many years, one of the only one in the entire ",264

1538,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,5,Interviewee,"… and then there's just a black hole in between, at times.  ",274
1539,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,6,Interviewer 1," So, what would you need to better respond to those water quality challenges?  ",275
1540,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,7,Interviewee,Let's see. That is a great question that I'm not sure how to answer.  ,276
1541,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,8,Interviewer 1," Or just to infrastructure challenges more in general, if that's…  ",277
1542,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,9,Interviewee,"Sure. I can't say enough about the remote maintenance worker team, right? So they're ",278

1544,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,9,Interviewee,positions to work with a bunch of 50 or so public water systems. I really can't say enough ,280
1545,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,9,Interviewee,"about that program. I feel like it's just such a success, for so many reasons, but that is one ",281
1546,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,9,Interviewee,of the things that exists within that black hole that I mentioned between the state ,282
1547,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,9,Interviewee,regulators and also our design engineer… Like our engineering staff that puts in water ,283
1548,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,9,Interviewee,"systems, and the local operations teams. So I think programs like that have really ",284
1549,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,9,Interviewee,impacted our region in a positive way. We need someone to bridge that gap. Service ,285
1550,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,9,Interviewee,providers. Go ahead.  ,286
1551,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,10,Interviewer 2," Yeah, can you expand a little bit, when you're talking about this knowledge gap, of why ",287
1552,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,11,Interviewer 2,you think it's present? Is it the rigid regulatory environment and structure? Is it ,288
1553,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,11,Interviewer 2,"communication issues? What do you think is causing that gap, and do you see any ways ",289
1554,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,11,Interviewer 2,to bridge it? And you mentioned the solution of the Remote Maintenance Worker ,290
1555,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,11,Interviewer 2,Program?  ,291
1556,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,12,Interviewee,"Yeah. I used to think like, ""Oh, we're just not communicating properly,"" we meaning like ",292
1557,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,295,12,Interviewee,"service providers or regulators, like we're just not communicating the needs well, right? ",293

1559,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,1,Interviewee,So like they didn't know they needed to take samples for lead and copper. I think that's ,295
1560,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,1,Interviewee,"definitely an oversimplification. I think my understanding has evolved, and when you have ",296
1561,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,1,Interviewee,"a small community water system that is severely resource-challenged, both in personnel ",297

1566,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,2,Interviewer 2, Okay.  ,302
1567,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,3,Interviewer 1, If we were going to look at the disconnect or the gap between operators and folks that ,303
1568,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,4,Interviewer 1,"are out in the field and the DEC and the state, do you… I mean, you used the word ",304
1569,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,4,Interviewer 1,miscommunication. How much of that do you feel is miscommunication? How much of ,305
1570,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,4,Interviewer 1,that do you feel is that people are just doing two separate jobs and they're not… Those ,306
1571,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,4,Interviewer 1,"jobs there somehow incongruent, or do you feel like there's a… Can you say something ",307
1572,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,4,Interviewer 1,"about that? I mean, is miscommunication, is that what you feel like is happening, or is ",308
1573,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,4,Interviewer 1,there another thing that could be happening? ,309
1574,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,5,Interviewee,"Yeah, I think that there's just competing priorities. So when you have a water plant ",310
1575,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,5,Interviewee,"operator who is on two hours a day, we're hoping he gets paid for those two hours a day. ",311
1576,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,5,Interviewee,"He may or may not. Hopefully he's trying to keep that system running, right? And it ",312
1577,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,5,Interviewee,"heated, and people online, and take care of… Like literally fighting fires, right? So it's just ",313
1578,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,5,Interviewee,"emergencies. We're just addressing emergencies, day in, day out. So sometimes taking ",314
1579,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,5,Interviewee,lead and copper samples is not the emergency fire that the operator is going to put time ,315
1580,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,5,Interviewee,"in, on his two hours a day that he may or may not get paid for.  ",316
1581,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,6,Interviewer 1, Okay. Can you describe a time when you've had to be creative responding to a challenge?  ,317
1582,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,7,Interviewee,"Gosh, now it feels like an interview question, like a real interview question.  ",318
1583,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,8,Interviewer 1, What are your strengths and weaknesses?  ,319
1584,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,9,Interviewee,All right.  ,320
1585,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,10,Interviewer 1, As it pertains to solving a water quality or infrastructure problem. How's that?  ,321
1586,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,11,Interviewee,"Okay. Yeah. So I think playing the long game, [REDACTED] noticed years ago is that it ",322
1587,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,11,Interviewee,wasn't just about the operations. We were not even getting to the point with some of our ,323
1588,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,11,Interviewee,"communities where we could be competitive for getting sanitation infrastructure funding, ",324
1589,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,11,Interviewee,because so many of the managerial components were lacking. So we were not even ,325
1590,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,11,Interviewee,scoring out high enough to get funding for water systems.  ,326
1591,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,12,Interviewee,And these are the few remaining communities in Alaska that don't have sewer ,327
1592,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,12,Interviewee,"infrastructure, right? So you would think that they would be competitive for getting water ",328
1593,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,296,12,Interviewee,"plants, because we have homes with no running water. But because the managerial ",329
1594,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,1,Interviewee,"capacity was so low, this goes back to the [REDACTED] best practices I mentioned, they ",330
1595,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,1,Interviewee,were just not scoring out high enough to really qualify for that funding to even get a ,331
1596,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,1,Interviewee,project.  ,332
1597,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,2,Interviewee,So I think one of the creative solutions over the years that I can think of is focusing on ,333
1598,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,2,Interviewee,"those upstream impacts, right? So, not just focusing on operating a water system, but if ",334
1599,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,2,Interviewee,"you want to get a new water system in a community, you would therefore have to go ",335
1600,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,2,Interviewee,upstream and work on resolving and building some of the managerial capacity so that ,336
1601,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,2,Interviewee,that can happen a few years later.  ,337
1602,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,3,Interviewer 1," When you say managerial capacity, do you mean for the… Like a [crosstalk] administrator?  ",338
1603,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,4,Interviewee,"Yeah, like city offices, yeah.  ",339
1604,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,5,Interviewer 1," Okay, so you don't mean trying to find a water plant operator specifically, you mean ",340
1605,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,6,Interviewer 1,upstream even of the… Above that?  ,341
1606,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,7,Interviewee,"Yeah. Yep, absolutely. Yeah. So, like helping the community entity enact good business ",342
1607,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,7,Interviewee,"practices so that they can show they have the revenue, and they have accountants on file, ",343
1608,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,7,Interviewee,and they have been to manager training. That is all before we even get to the operations ,344
1609,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,7,Interviewee,point.  ,345
1610,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,8,Interviewer 1, Great. You touched on this before. What challenges are unique to your utility due to the ,346
1611,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,9,Interviewer 1,Arctic conditions? [inaudible] else that…  ,347
1612,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,10,Interviewee,"Yeah, I mean, I feel like probably most of the ones that I can think of off the top of my ",348
1613,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,10,Interviewee,"head, we've already hit on through the course of our discussion. But I think the last ",349
1614,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,10,Interviewee,remaining communities in Alaska to get running water and sewer are probably for a good ,350
1615,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,10,Interviewee,reason. Either there's no easy water source or there's no good way to put in a distribution ,351
1616,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,10,Interviewee,"system, so there's certainly some engineering challenges that remain.  ",352
1617,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,11,Interviewee,"However, in the other communities, I would just say it's hard to run a functional water ",353
1618,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,11,Interviewee,"system in permafrost, and in an Arctic environment, especially when you only have a user ",354
1619,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,11,Interviewee,fee base of maybe 200 households. There's just not always an economy to support such ,355
1620,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,11,Interviewee,"an endeavor. And then, we did talk a little bit about the intermittent or seasonal ",356
1621,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,11,Interviewee,"availability of people, and how intermittent access changes the game a bit too. Those are ",357
1622,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,11,Interviewee,the three that come to mind.  ,358
1623,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,12,Interviewer 1," Okay. Well, talking about climate change, how does climate change impact your water ",359
1624,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,13,Interviewer 1,"infrastructure system? Or maybe a better question is, does it?  ",360
1625,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,14,Interviewee,"Yeah, I wish I had some pictures that were easy to access. So, yes, it absolutely does. ",361
1626,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,14,Interviewee,Permafrost and changing climates and storms all impact infrastructure. We had some ,362
1627,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,14,Interviewee,"really graphic photos that our [REDACTED] took a couple years ago that I'm thinking of, ",363
1628,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,297,14,Interviewee,"where you have like the pilings that the Arctic pipe is built on, right?  ",364
1629,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,1,Interviewee,"So we have this above-ground HDPE Arctic pipe, and we have posts and pads that the ",365
1630,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,1,Interviewee,"pipes are built on. And those, we're doing what we call jacking, which I'm sure is not a ",366
1631,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,1,Interviewee,"specific term, but that's the only thing the guys ever call it. And they're just like, the ",367
1632,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,1,Interviewee,permafrost is… They're just going up and moving all around. So it's hard to run a ,368
1633,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,1,Interviewee,"distribution system, HDPE… The Arctic pipe when you have shifting ground, so to speak. ",369
1634,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,1,Interviewee,"And many of those would become unlevel, and move inches in a year and have to be ",370
1635,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,1,Interviewee,repaired and fixed. So that's one thing that comes to mind. Intake also has been an issue. ,371
1636,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,1,Interviewee,"The changing pattern and the fall sea storms, especially, have certainly impacted some of ",372
1637,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,1,Interviewee,our intake systems.  ,373
1638,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,2,Interviewer 1," Sorry to jump around a little bit, but you'd mentioned talking to operators and talking to ",374
1639,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,3,Interviewer 1,city officials and talking occasionally to lay public. Have you had an opportunity to talk to ,375
1640,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,3,Interviewer 1,"people about climate change? I mean, you mentioned putting out fires, and sometimes ",376
1641,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,3,Interviewer 1,"climate change feels like a long-term goal, but what would you want people to know? ",377
1642,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,3,Interviewer 1,How would you talk to people about climate change and how it affects water ,378
1643,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,3,Interviewer 1,infrastructure?  ,379
1644,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,4,Interviewee,"Sure. I think, well, we have a few communities that I would say are on the forefront of ",380
1645,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,4,Interviewee,"planning for climate change, but mostly that's because they're in dire need of… Like ",381
1646,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,4,Interviewee,they're being severely threatened by erosion. So the most notable community in the ,382
1647,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,4,Interviewee,"region is [REDACTED], and they've been moving their community site to [REDACTED], ",383
1648,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,4,Interviewee,another… Relocating entirely.  ,384
1649,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,5,Interviewee,So I think it's easier to have those conversations in communities where you're seeing the ,385
1650,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,5,Interviewee,"impacts, right? So you have a severely threatened shoreline that is edging up to the ",386
1651,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,5,Interviewee,"[REDACTED], and the [REDACTED] is about to fall in the water. It's easy to have that ",387
1652,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,5,Interviewee,conversation when you're under threat of a fire in the next few years versus long-term.  ,388
1653,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,6,Interviewer 1," Yeah, there's probably fewer people questioning whether it's happening or not.  ",389
1654,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,7,Interviewee,"Exactly, yeah.  ",390
1655,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,8,Interviewer 1," Okay. So, with all the things we've talked about, what infrastructure challenge do you ",391
1656,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,9,Interviewer 1,"think is the most important to fix, and when ? ",392
1657,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,10,Interviewee,"I don't know how to answer that, I mean, if I think more specific to infrastructure, I would ",393
1658,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,10,Interviewee,probably hone in on the distribution systems a little bit. That's where many of our ,394
1659,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,10,Interviewee,"challenges fall into, so maybe distribution systems, and… Yes, that is important to fix ",395
1660,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,10,Interviewee,"immediately. Yeah, I don't know how to answer that one.  ",396
1661,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,11,Interviewer 1," Sure, yeah. I thought maybe immediately would be [crosstalk].  ",397
1662,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,12,Interviewee,Yesterday? I don't know.  ,398
1663,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,298,13,Interviewer 1, Right. Right.  ,399
1664,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,1,Interviewee,"Before winter, for sure.  ",400
1665,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,2,Interviewer 1," So, if you were… I mean, you mentioned distribution systems, and specifically what does ",401
1666,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,3,Interviewer 1,that mean? What change would you want to see?  ,402
1667,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,4,Interviewee,"Yeah, I mean, so I think I mentioned like in terms of infrastructure, number one, ",403
1668,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,4,Interviewee,"distribution systems, and number two, managerial capacity, and running a water system, ",404
1669,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,4,Interviewee,"and having the finances to do so, and how it's really expensive and costly and time-",405
1670,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,4,Interviewee,consuming.  ,406
1671,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,5,Interviewee,So I think magically having funding available would fix some things. Having less turnover ,407
1672,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,5,Interviewee,among operators would fix a lot of things. When I look at the functional water systems in ,408
1673,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,5,Interviewee,"the region, most of those are ones that have a long-term water plant operator and a ",409
1674,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,5,Interviewee,"backup, right? So, people who know the job inside and out, and have been doing that for ",410
1675,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,5,Interviewee,a number of years. Yeah.  ,411
1676,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,6,Interviewer 1," To the question of distribution, though, I mean, is piped… What is the distribution ",412
1677,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,7,Interviewer 1,"solution, I guess, if you could wave your wand and change the infrastructure that exists? ",413
1678,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,7,Interviewer 1,"I know in [REDACTED], piped water has a lot of advantages. I mean, is that the right ",414
1679,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,7,Interviewer 1,"answer for the region, or is there… Also I know there's some negatives about small tank ",415
1680,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,7,Interviewer 1,and haul.  ,416
1681,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,8,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative).  ,417
1682,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,9,Interviewer 1," So, for distribution, what's the answer?  ",418
1683,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,10,Interviewee,"Yeah, so I think, as someone with a health background, who's really interested in the ",419
1684,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,10,Interviewee,"health impacts of water, I tend to think that piped water service is the solution, but ",420
1685,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,10,Interviewee,certainly not because it's easy to wave a magic wand and fix infrastructure-wise. So I ,421
1686,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,10,Interviewee,believe there's a health equity and an argument to be made for people having ample ,422
1687,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,10,Interviewee,"water to use. And we see, of course, [inaudible] decrease in many infectious diseases. But ",423

1689,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,10,Interviewee,it's tough to foot the bill for things like that. So I have no magic solution. Sorry. I bet you ,425
1690,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,10,Interviewee,came here expecting that.  ,426
1691,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,11,Interviewer 1," Well, this was a waste.  ",427
1692,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,12,Interviewee,"Oh, yeah. So I don't know. I don't know what that magic wand would do, short of more ",428

1694,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,13,Interviewer 1," Okay. So, just like a job interview, if you feel like you've answered these questions, you ",430
1695,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,14,Interviewer 1,"don't have to repeat the same thing, but the next question is about system failures. So, ",431
1696,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,14,Interviewer 1,can you describe system failures or issues such as pipe breaks or periods of time without ,432
1697,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,299,14,Interviewer 1,water? Has that happened? What does it look like?  ,433
1698,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, I mean, it looks different in places, different places. I'm thinking most recently of ",434

1701,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,1,Interviewee,"houses down, there was some kind of freeze with the water system, and then all the ",437
1702,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,1,Interviewee,"alarms went off down the road, and that… It was resolved. So I don't know the specifics ",438
1703,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,1,Interviewee,"of that, but certainly, yeah, I think about that.  ",439
1704,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,2,Interviewee,I think about line breaks. I think about those posts and pads that the Arctic pipe is built ,440
1705,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,2,Interviewee,"on, and how it's literally jutting out of the ground. I think about physical… The foundation ",441
1706,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,2,Interviewee,"of water plant buildings, how some of them have become like this over time. Yeah.  ",442
1707,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,3,Interviewer 1," Okay. So, thinking about future infrastructure, what do you or your organization consider ",443
1708,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,4,Interviewer 1,"when planning for, or building new infrastructure?  ",444
1709,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,5,Interviewee,"Sure. Yeah, so my role in all of this has been as a service provider and as community ",445
1710,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,5,Interviewee,"liaison, so my team, we don't design water systems. We're the ones left holding the ",446
1711,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,5,Interviewee,"operator's hands, operating after a new system is put in. So we really try to have a ",447
1712,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,5,Interviewee,"pragmatic approach to making simple, easy-to-run systems without a ton of automation.  ",448

1718,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,8,Interviewer 1," Like one that's controlled by a fax machine, or…  ",454

1720,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,10,Interviewer 1, How has your community's water system or water operations changed over time?  ,456
1721,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,11,Interviewee,The biggest thing that comes to mind is when we have operator turnover. So we talked ,457
1722,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,11,Interviewee,"about small communities with maybe 200 homes, and limited people working as water ",458
1723,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,11,Interviewee,plant operators. And I've seen the operator turnover. We'll have a longtime operator of ,459
1724,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,11,Interviewee,"like [REDACTED] years running a system in the same community, and when that changes, ",460
1725,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,11,Interviewee,"we have, I think a major impact on the water system. It's amazing in a small town, what a ",461
1726,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,11,Interviewee,change in personnel of literally one person can do. So that's what comes to mind.  ,462
1727,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,12,Interviewer 1," Has there been any physical infrastructure changes over time? I mean, are things trending ",463
1728,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,13,Interviewer 1,"in a direction? I know that some people… New things are being built, other things are ",464
1729,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,13,Interviewer 1,being broken down or falling apart? Is there new technology or direction?  ,465
1730,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,14,Interviewee,"Yeah. I mean, there's generally a trend for more complicated systems, so that is certainly ",466
1731,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,300,14,Interviewee,happening. [REDACTED] over the last [REDACTED] years. When I started doing ,467
1732,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED], the water systems looked a little bit different, right? So [REDACTED] a lot of ",468
1733,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,1,Interviewee,"water plants from like the 1970s and '80s when [REDACTED] put a lot of them in, and now ",469
1734,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,1,Interviewee,"those systems are failing and they're getting upgrades, and then we have new systems ",470
1735,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,1,Interviewee,"that have been put in in the last [REDACTED] years. So in terms of complexity, I would say ",471
1736,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,1,Interviewee,that's changed.  ,472
1737,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,2,Interviewer 1," Okay, great. So, moving on to some questions about people and workforce, and some of ",473
1738,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,3,Interviewer 1,"this, again, you've touched on before, but turnover, obviously, what workforce challenges ",474
1739,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,3,Interviewer 1,do you face? How do you respond to that?  ,475
1740,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,4,Interviewee,"Yeah, I think a general shortage of people to fill the positions, and turnover, and I don't ",476
1741,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,4,Interviewee,"always know how to address that, because it's been a constant struggle. I think as service ",477
1742,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,4,Interviewee,"providers, we've really tried to invest in… Well, in training, in operational supports, in ",478
1743,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,4,Interviewee,"answering those calls for help when they come up, and I'm speaking really more of the ",479
1744,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,4,Interviewee,"remote maintenance worker team than [REDACTED]. Of being good partners, of being ",480
1745,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,4,Interviewee,"advocates for the community needs. And that's been our role, to really help improve ",481
1746,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,4,Interviewee,"operator satisfaction and longevity, but it's still a challenge, for sure.  ",482
1747,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,5,Interviewer 1, Yeah. You mentioned training. Do you mean the water plant operator training or other ,483
1748,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,6,Interviewer 1,training?  ,484
1749,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,7,Interviewee,"Yeah, operator training, some. So the classroom water plant operator trainings ",485
1750,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,7,Interviewee,"[REDACTED], I mentioned that, really that is aimed at a couple of things. Helping operators ",486
1751,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,7,Interviewee,"pass a water treatment exam, and providing CEUs, continuing education units, so that ",487
1752,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,7,Interviewee,"they're able to renew their certification. But in terms of, is that useful to how they run ",488
1753,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,7,Interviewee,"their water plants on a day-to-day basis, maybe, maybe not. So [REDACTED] a lot of ",489
1754,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,7,Interviewee,"informal and formal training on site [REDACTED] in the community, in someone's water ",490
1755,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,7,Interviewee,plant. And I would say that's more meaningful in terms of helping an operator run his or ,491
1756,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,7,Interviewee,her water system.  ,492
1757,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,8,Interviewer 2," So, when you were saying, right, it seems like there's this by-the-books certification, right? ",493
1758,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,9,Interviewer 2,"Like the classroom training, and then this onsite, where you're saying it's more fruitful ",494
1759,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,9,Interviewer 2,and helpful. How could you see that overlap get a little closer together? I don't know if ,495
1760,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,9,Interviewer 2,"that made sense how I worded it, but to where the classroom work is actually going to ",496
1761,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,9,Interviewer 2,help maybe more directly these operators run their systems.  ,497
1762,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,10,Interviewee,"Yeah, that's super tough because a few years ago… Gosh, they blur together. I'm trying to ",498
1763,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,10,Interviewee,"remember what year this was. I think… Gosh, I don't remember. [REDACTED]. Our state ",499
1764,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,10,Interviewee,"water plant operator training and certification team, the state folks that make the water ",500
1765,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,10,Interviewee,"plant operator certification program and tests, they went with the national ABC ",501
1766,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,10,Interviewee,standards.  ,502
1767,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,11,Interviewee,"So now it's like a nationally certified exam, and the things that you study in the book to ",503
1768,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,11,Interviewee,pass that exam are sometimes very different than what you see in a rural Alaska water ,504
1769,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,301,11,Interviewee,system. So we're trying to teach rural Alaska water plant operators these things in this ,505
1770,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,1,Interviewee,"national exam book, and that is challenging. So I'm not sure, [REDACTED], but I would like ",506
1771,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,1,Interviewee,"to see that. That would be a vision. Maybe magical wand, I would wave that, and then ",507
1772,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,1,Interviewee,suddenly this exam would also help people run their systems on a day-to-day basis.  ,508
1773,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,2,Interviewer 1," I mean, that could… I mean, before it was national standards, it was a state… The state ",509
1774,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,3,Interviewer 1,"dictated the test, right?  ",510
1775,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,4,Interviewee,Yes.  ,511
1776,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,5,Interviewer 1," So, I mean, it's not crazy. That was a decision that was made, it is a… I mean, right?  ",512
1777,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,6,Interviewee,"Somebody made that decision, for sure.  ",513
1778,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,7,Interviewer 1," So it doesn't necessarily have to be that way, or are there federal standards for how the ",514
1779,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,8,Interviewer 1,"test would have to be, even if we don't follow that specific testing protocol?  ",515
1780,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,9,Interviewee,"I do not know the answer to that question, but it's worth exploring.  ",516
1781,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,10,Interviewer 1, Okay.  ,517
1782,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,11,Interviewee,"I don't know what prompted the change. I just remember, as a service provider, being a ",518
1783,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,11,Interviewee,very difficult time.  ,519
1784,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,12,Interviewer 1, Did it change test scores? Did it change retention? Did it- ,520
1785,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,13,Interviewee,"Yes, absolutely. Test scores did exactly what you expect them to do, yeah.  ",521
1786,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,14,Interviewer 1," Okay. And do you feel like it changed the workforce? I mean, did it change turnover, or ",522
1787,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,15,Interviewer 1,did it change job satisfaction? Did it change the quality of the work people were doing?  ,523
1788,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,16,Interviewee,"I don't know. I don't know that I can speak to that. I did just get a… Yeah, I'm not sure. I ",524
1789,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,16,Interviewee,"do sometimes get a sense that now, the people who are sitting in the classes are maybe ",525
1790,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,16,Interviewee,the people who can test a little bit better. Like now that we have a better understanding ,526
1791,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,16,Interviewee,of the testing needs and how you have to have a basic understanding of some math ,527
1792,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,16,Interviewee,"principles, maybe we're sending people to the classroom who are going to be more well-",528
1793,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,16,Interviewee,"equipped to take that exam, and that's not necessarily the person that will do the best ",529
1794,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,16,Interviewee,job running the water system. So it's maybe changed the face a little bit of the operators ,530
1795,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,16,Interviewee,we see in training and those that are getting certified.  ,531
1796,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,17,Interviewer 1, Okay. Is there anything else that you would think of in terms of being able to respond to ,532
1797,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,18,Interviewer 1,"these challenges, anything else that would help that you'd want?  ",533
1798,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,19,Interviewee,"Lots of things, yeah. I mentioned the RMW program because I think it's done more for ",534
1799,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,19,Interviewee,"operations in the region than any other program, so I think about that. [REDACTED] a ",535
1800,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,302,19,Interviewee,"grant funded utility management program for five years, [REDACTED], and that was, in ",536
1801,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,1,Interviewee,"my opinion, phenomenally successful at helping… You know I mentioned the upstream, ",537
1802,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,1,Interviewee,"you have to go upstream, right? So, helping create successful, financially viable business ",538
1803,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,1,Interviewee,"operations so that they're better equipped to run the operations piece, I feel like that is ",539
1804,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,1,Interviewee,"really important, focusing on that upstream business piece.  ",540
1805,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,2,Interviewee,"I mean, funding, I feel like stakeholders are always saying like, ""We need more funding,"" ",541
1806,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,2,Interviewee,"and I will continue saying that if we want Bush Alaska to have running water, that funding ",542
1807,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,2,Interviewee,is going to have to come from somewhere other than the communities. And lots of other ,543
1808,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,2,Interviewee,stuff.  ,544
1809,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,3,Interviewer 1," So, financial challenges, where does funding for capital projects… Where does that come ",545
1810,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,4,Interviewer 1,from?  ,546
1811,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,5,Interviewee,The man. ,547
1812,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,6,Interviewer 1, Okay [crosstalk]- ,548
1813,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,7,Interviewee,Just kidding. So it's all federal money that's passed through to ANTHC or Village Safe ,549
1814,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,7,Interviewee,Water. And it's highly competitive.  ,550
1815,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,8,Interviewer 1," And do you have a role in that, helping villages get funding or is that separate from…  ",551
1816,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,9,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] each of the tribal health organizations, [REDACTED], has a small piece in that. ",552
1817,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,9,Interviewee,So the engineers at [REDACTED] on the state side put in a bunch of data for every potential ,553
1818,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,9,Interviewee,"project, right? So [REDACTED] have engineers that put in for potential projects, right? So ",554
1819,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,9,Interviewee,"they can say, ""Community X over here has a failing water treatment plant, and we need ",555
1820,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,9,Interviewee,"to revamp the filtration system."" So, they will put together a project with cost estimates, ",556

1822,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,10,Interviewee,"And then that goes into the statewide database, called SDS, Sanitation Deficiency System. ",558
1823,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,10,Interviewee,It's very complicated. [REDACTED] and the other tribal health organizations have one ,559
1824,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,10,Interviewee,"piece in that where they get to apply what we call tribal force. So they get to say like, ",560
1825,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,10,Interviewee,"""Which projects do we feel like we want to support?"" And they support that with numbers ",561
1826,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,10,Interviewee,"and force. And then all of that goes to a funding committee, and eventually each project ",562
1827,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,10,Interviewee,"is scored out with a numerical score, and the top, whatever, percentage of them get some ",563
1828,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,10,Interviewee,funding. And that's all based on the funding that's available that year.  ,564
1829,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,303,11,Interviewee,"And there's an unmet need of something like, I'm sure I'm going to say the wrong number, ",565

1834,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,1,Interviewer 1," You mentioned the costs to the customers, and how it oftentimes wasn't enough to cover ",570
1835,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,2,Interviewer 1,"the cost of operations. So, specifically, is it that customers have trouble paying their bills, ",571

1840,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,3,Interviewee,"to pay, and so they… I don't know the exact numbers, but they'll go into a community, ",576
1841,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,3,Interviewee,"determine that people are willing to pay like $120 to $160 a month, right? And we talked ",577
1842,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,3,Interviewee,about really needing the managerial support. So they will be a partner to the community ,578

1844,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,3,Interviewee,operator training. So they'll go in and assist a community.  ,580
1845,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,4,Interviewee,"And what they've found is that they have a pretty high collection rate, like 90… Upwards ",581
1846,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,4,Interviewee,"of 90%, and they certainly seem to run specials where people can apply their PFD and pay ",582
1847,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,4,Interviewee,"for their water bill throughout the year. And they have other programs. So, this outside ",583
1848,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,4,Interviewee,"third-party cooperative is going in and they're increasing user rates, and they have some ",584
1849,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,4,Interviewee,of the highest collection rates that any of the communities have. And then you go to ,585
1850,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,4,Interviewee,"another community without that and they'll say, ""Oh, people just won't pay their bills,"" ",586
1851,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,4,Interviewee,and they'll have less than a 50% collection rate. So we see very different things in terms ,587
1852,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,4,Interviewee,of how much people are willing to pay and collection rates.  ,588
1853,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,5,Interviewer 1," Okay, and so you're saying that the primary difference, then, is ARUC specifically?  ",589
1854,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,6,Interviewee,"We have the best numbers from ARUC, so most of what we know about rates and ",590
1855,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,6,Interviewee,"collection… Like collection rates and monthly user fees, are from ARUC, because they ",591
1856,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,6,Interviewee,"track it so well, and they make that available. And another community may or may not be ",592
1857,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,6,Interviewee,"tracking it well, and might not make it available. So what I know about user rates mostly ",593
1858,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,6,Interviewee,"comes from ARUC, which is this third party program that is assisting a community with ",594
1859,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,6,Interviewee,running their system.  ,595
1860,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,7,Interviewer 1, What happens when people don't pay their bills?  ,596
1861,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,8,Interviewee,Yeah. Eventually the operators don't get paid. The water plant has a hard time purchasing ,597
1862,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,8,Interviewee,"things that they need, like chemicals. They don't pay for testing. They really just literally ",598
1863,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,8,Interviewee,"don't pay for anything that they can't afford. Parts, spare parts.  ",599
1864,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,9,Interviewer 1," What happens to the… Does the water get shut off to people's homes, then?  ",600
1865,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,10,Interviewee,"I mean, that would be a worst-case scenario, that would be a giant fail, but that could ",601
1866,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,10,Interviewee,"happen, right? So we could have, like I'm thinking of one example where the filter went ",602
1867,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,10,Interviewee,"down, and so you have… And they weren't at the time able to buy the parts they needed ",603
1868,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,10,Interviewee,"to repair that. So you can either pump untreated water or you can turn it off, so to speak.  ",604
1869,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,304,11,Interviewer 1, Yeah. I guess I was more thinking for if I'm an individual customer and I don't pay my bill.  ,605
1870,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,606
1871,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,2,Interviewer 1, Do I no longer get water at my house and everyone else does?  ,607
1872,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,3,Interviewee,"Wide-ranging practices. So, again, the best data we have on that comes from a ARUC. ",608
1873,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,3,Interviewee,"Speaking from ARUC, they pay their operators to shut off the house after like 90 days of ",609
1874,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,3,Interviewee,"nonpayment, right? So they have a pretty firm plan. They stick to that plan. What we find ",610
1875,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,3,Interviewee,"in other communities is everything, right? So a wide variation of practices. But I have ",611
1876,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,3,Interviewee,"heard from some operators that they don't want to turn off so-and-so's water, right? ",612
1877,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,3,Interviewee,"They've got a bunch of kids, or it's their grandfather and they may not want to do that. ",613
1878,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,3,Interviewee,"The managerial entity might not have firm policies to cause that to happen, as well. So ",614
1879,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,3,Interviewee,"outside of ARUC, it varies community by community.  ",615
1880,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,4,Interviewer 1," Okay. [REDACTED], before we move on, is there anything else you wanted to drill down ",616
1881,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,5,Interviewer 1,on?  ,617
1882,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,6,Interviewer 2, Yeah. I wanted to ask a couple questions about the community specifically. You've ,618
1883,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,7,Interviewer 2,"mentioned a couple times throughout that your goal is to advocate for communities, and ",619
1884,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,7,Interviewer 2,you've worked directly with communities. What do you think water means to the public? ,620
1885,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,7,Interviewer 2,And can you expand a little bit more on public perceptions towards water services? I know ,621
1886,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,7,Interviewer 2,"you started at the beginning, you talked a little bit about how people sometimes will use ",622
1887,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,7,Interviewer 2,"traditional sources, but can you expand on that a little bit more?  ",623
1888,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,8,Interviewee,"Yeah, sure. I did a project when I was at [REDACTED] that really explored the reasons that ",624
1889,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,8,Interviewee,"people choose to use untreated water, so I think that's informed a lot of what I'm saying ",625
1890,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,8,Interviewee,here today. And the number one reason that people shared as far as why they prefer ,626
1891,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,8,Interviewee,untreated water that's not from the water plant is really just like a preference for natural ,627
1892,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,8,Interviewee,"things, or, ""This is the way that we've always done it. This is the way our elders did it.""  ",628
1893,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,9,Interviewee,"We also heard some people say that they don't like the taste or the chemicals, that they ",629
1894,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,9,Interviewee,"would share that it makes their coffee taste bad or funny. And then also, there's a ",630
1895,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,9,Interviewee,"convenience factor, right? So, in homes without running water, where they don't have ",631
1896,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,9,Interviewee,"treated water directly coming out of their faucet, it's sometimes more work to get treated ",632
1897,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,9,Interviewee,"water to your house than to use rainwater, right? So there's a convenience factor and ",633
1898,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,9,Interviewee,"there's a cost factor, not just in terms of actual money that you pay for the water, but in ",634
1899,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,9,Interviewee,terms of manpower and resources and time to go collect the water.  ,635
1900,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,10,Interviewee,So those are some of the key themes that we found in [REDACTED] communities in this ,636
1901,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,10,Interviewee,"region that we were working with, and that was really in order of preference, so a ",637
1902,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,10,Interviewee,"preference for natural things, and, ""This is what we've always done,"" and, ""This is a ",638
1903,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,10,Interviewee,"cultural practice,"" that really ranked pretty highly.  ",639
1904,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,11,Interviewer 2," And when you're talking about operator training, as well, do you think that same tendency ",640
1905,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,12,Interviewer 2,"towards like, ""Oh, this is how we've done it,"" or, ""This is how we've always ran the ",641
1906,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,305,12,Interviewer 2,"system,"" does that come to play when you're talking about operator training as well? And ",642
1907,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,1,Interviewer 2,"do you have any suggestions to… Or any times where you've seen it be very impactful, ",643
1908,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,1,Interviewer 2,"the way that people are training operators, in terms of using their knowledge that they ",644
1909,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,1,Interviewer 2,already have based on knowledge from elders or from their previous work? That was a ,645
1910,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,1,Interviewer 2,"long-winded question, so let me know if you want me to rephrase.  ",646
1911,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,2,Interviewee,"Yeah. No, I definitely have seen operators who may really be hesitant to put any chemicals ",647
1912,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,2,Interviewee,"in the water, so that is a real thing. And I have seen operators have a breakthrough ",648
1913,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,2,Interviewee,"moment when, especially with breakpoint chlorination, where if you reach the right level ",649
1914,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,2,Interviewee,"of treatment, the water coming out doesn't taste or smell like chemicals, right?  ",650
1915,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,3,Interviewer 2, Yeah.  ,651
1916,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,4,Interviewee,"So if you reach that right mix of treatment, you're having good, finished water at the end ",652
1917,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,4,Interviewee,"that doesn't smell like chlorine, it doesn't taste like bleach, and it makes your coffee taste ",653
1918,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,4,Interviewee,"good. So I think if you can convince an operator that like, ""We can make good water that ",654
1919,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,4,Interviewee,"people will like, and still use the proper treatment processes,"" I mean, that's the dream, ",655
1920,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,4,Interviewee,right?  ,656
1921,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,5,Interviewee,"But especially with fluorides, so as somebody with a public health background, part of my ",657
1922,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,5,Interviewee,"work is not just to have water that's free from microorganisms, but also water that's ",658
1923,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,5,Interviewee,"healthful, and fluoride is a part of that. And we don't have very much community water ",659
1924,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,5,Interviewee,"fluoridation in the region, and we have many operators who are not wanting to add ",660
1925,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,5,Interviewee,"fluoride. It's not required, like chlorine, in a lot of places. So there's just generally like, ",661
1926,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,5,Interviewee,don't want to add more chemicals to water. I do feel like that's an overarching attitude.  ,662
1927,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,6,Interviewer 2," Okay, and that's because the… Do you think that's a cultural relationship with water, that, ",663
1928,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,7,Interviewer 2,"just tendency towards not wanting to add more to water, and wanting to use natural ",664
1929,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,7,Interviewer 2,resources?  ,665
1930,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,8,Interviewee,"I think so, maybe.  ",666
1931,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,9,Interviewer 2, Okay.  ,667
1932,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,10,Interviewee,"Yeah. I mean, part of that is speculation, but part of that is, that was one of the themes ",668
1933,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,10,Interviewee,"that came up in the research that I was doing as well, so it supports that.  ",669
1934,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,11,Interviewer 2," Okay. I think I asked all my questions, so- ",670
1935,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,12,Interviewer 1, Great.  ,671
1936,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,13,Interviewer 2, [crosstalk] keep going forward.  ,672
1937,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,14,Interviewer 1," Yeah, well, so… ",673
1938,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,306,15,Interviewer 2, Thank you.  ,674
1939,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,307,1,Interviewer 1," Yeah, I think we're about done. [REDACTED], is there anything else that you would like to ",675
1940,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,307,2,Interviewer 1,add? Is there anything we should have asked you?  ,676
1941,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,307,3,Interviewee,Not that comes to mind right now. Thank you. It's been a very thorough interview. Thanks ,677
1942,21-22 Combined,INTERVIEW 17 ,307,3,Interviewee,for hearing me out. Appreciate the work that you all are doing. I remember speaking with ,678

16,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewer,And we're good to go. So. ,1
0,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"So we use the water, it's just like back at home in the village. Like all we use the water just like as a ",2
1,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"everyday like necessity skills like we use it to like, like wash our clothes and like we use it to cook and ",3
2,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"we use it to like basically basically like, like we use water on a daily basis like we probably like flush out ",4

4,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"other than, you guys are like more than feel free to like ask any question like how we use water. ",6
17,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's great. That's really helpful. How do you get the water? Do you have- [crosstalk] ",7
5,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"We have to like go out and pack it. We go to these lakes and then we're just like like, we use our ",8
6,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"filtration systems like um we filter the water and then we, like everybody knows like we don't drink water ",9
7,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,the dirty waters like clean it and then filter it and then go through like three different kinds of filters I ,10
8,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,think you probably you guys probably know like [inaudible] liquids or [inaudible]some kind of water filter ,11
9,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"filtration systems like I can't even explain what the filter is, I forgot what the brand was called. But other ",12
10,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"than that, we use it on the daily. ",13
18,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewer,Do you do that with all of the water you use or just the water you’re drinking? ,14
11,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"Um, all of the water yeah. ",15
19,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewer,So all of the water you’re using to wash and stuff you also make sure all that’s filtered before you use it. ,16
12,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,It goes through like three different kinds of filtration system just going like like picking stripping the lake ,17
13,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"and just use it as like a drinking water, we have to filter it like three different times. Other than that we ",18
14,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,"use it to cook, clean and like basically like we use it to like cook, clean and use it for like everyday ",19
15,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewee,necessities. ,20
20,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewer,And so you're gonna go out to the lake and you'll like bring your containers for the water? Or are you ,21
21,April 22,Interview 1 ,1,2,Interviewer,getting- ,22
22,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewee,We go somewhere like a place a couple of miles out like three to four miles out. We go to like different ,23
23,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewee,"spots like we just don't like get water from the same lake like, like we go to like different lakes like we ",24
24,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewee,try to find like the cleanest water there is. ,25
31,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewer,And is it back on snowmobiles? Or how are you bringing it back? ,26
25,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, like the back of snow machines like in a sled? I think I’ve got some pictures showing how we ",27
26,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewee,"pack our ice and our water. Oh, hold on a second. ",28
32,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewer,"Ok, yeah so it's a little different when it's in the winter or the summer. ",29
27,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewee,Mmhmm(affirmative). ,30
33,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewer,Do you all live together  ,31
29,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewee ,Mm(affirmative). ,32
34,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewer,Yeah. What were you doing in [REDACTED]? What were you doing here? ,33
30,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewee ,"I went for a [inaudible] and this is how we get our water like, that's in the wintertime.  ",34
35,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] ,35
36,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewer,"Good, I’m glad to hear that. Do you go together to get water or who is responsible for getting water? ",36
28,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewee,"Depends on who wants to do it, like it's like a desired chore. ",37
37,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewer,Is it a good one? Or are there other ones that are better chores? Like is getting water like a good job or ,38
38,April 22,Interview 1 ,2,1,Interviewer,"it's like okay, I'm the last one to get water today. ",39
39,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee,It'll probably be like the last chore the day. Most of the time where I was doing subsistence like doing ,40
40,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee,"subsistence activities like hunting, fishing. Like I do a lot of hunting activities and my siblings and my ",41
41,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee,parents always try to tell me to like relax and calm down even if I have like any procedures or even if I ,42
42,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee,had like any hospital visits. They always tell me to like sit down and relax but it just goes in one ear and ,43
43,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee,"goes out the other, you know? Like I’ll be like I gotta go do something. ",44
52,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewer,Yeah you’re like keeping busy.  ,45
44,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee,Like I'm always busy. I just can't stay still  ,46
53,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewer,Yeah  ,47
45,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,48
54,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewer,How often do you have to go to get water? Is that every day or you do it like once a week? ,49
46,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee,Once or twice a week depending depending on how many like how many buckets we have. ,50
55,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewer,And so what do you do in the summer? ,51
47,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee ,"Summertime I'm always like on a boat, on a fishing boat for like I mean just traveling or like basically ",52
48,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee ,like right behind the wheel or right behind the throttle like wide open throttle. ,53
56,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewer,"Nice, beautiful. ",54
49,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee ,"Other than that, I'll either be like working or like going to work somewhere like [inaudible] gold or like on ",55
50,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee ,a fishing boat but I retired my fishing career so I'm just gonna be like going back to gold mining soon ,56
51,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewee ,but I still haven't decided when to go back to gold mining. ,57
57,April 22,Interview 1 ,3,1,Interviewer,Yeah. And so you  like collect buckets of water in the summer as you're driving a boat? ,58
58,April 22,Interview 1 ,4,1,Interviewee ,I think we like we use like rain gutters like from the roof. Like we pack our water like like in like those ,59
59,April 22,Interview 1 ,4,1,Interviewee ,buckets it's just like shipping off the rain rain gutters. We still go through like water water [crosstalk]  ,60
66,April 22,Interview 1 ,4,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] ,61
67,April 22,Interview 1 ,4,1,Interviewer,So does it taste - how does it taste?  ,62
60,April 22,Interview 1 ,4,1,Interviewee ,"[inaudible], pretty good. ",63
72,April 22,Interview 1 ,4,1,Interviewer ,Good. ,64
61,April 22,Interview 1 ,4,1,Interviewee ,The water? ,65
73,April 22,Interview 1 ,4,1,Interviewer ,"Yeah, you like it? ",66

262,April 22,Interview 10 ,75,1,Interviewee,"I – no, I don’t. ",186
271,April 22,Interview 10 ,76,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Awesome. Well, I'll go ahead and I'm gonna stop this. ",187
282,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewer,"So, first can you tell me a little bit about yourself? ",1
272,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,"[REDACTED; Introductions]. So when I got up here, I was gonna work the airlines for the fringe benefit. ",2
273,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,"If not, then with the city hauling water. ",3
283,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewer,"Oh, really?  ",4
274,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,"Then, I saw the [inaudible] that drivers go through, especially in wintertime. I was like, man, no. I've ",5
275,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,"messed my back up a few, been operated on and that wasn’t gonna work. So now I [REDACTED]. ",6
284,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's interesting that you say you were looking at haul like driving the water truck, but it seems ",7
285,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewer,like a really hard job. ,8
276,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,"Yeah. You know, dragging the hauls through my back wouldn't handle it. ",9
286,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. So you've lived here for about [REDACTED] you said. ",10
277,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,Yep. ,11
287,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewer,So tell me about your water system. ,12
278,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,"You know, we have hauled water, obviously. Our tank was metal since I’ve been here but I find it dirty.  ",13
279,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,So my landlord replaced it with a plastic tank. But it’s still rusty water. I got a lot a lot iron in it. So I buy ,14
280,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,my water. A filter down here in [REDACTED]. That's what that's our drinking water and cooking water. ,15
288,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay. So those are the jobs, right? The kind of yeah, get delivered. So you drink and cook with ",16
289,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewer,that water.  ,17
281,April 22,Interview 11 ,77,2,Interviewee,Yeah.  ,18
298,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewer,"And then you use other water for like, showers and laundry. ",19
290,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewee,And laundry. Yep. ,20
299,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewer,"Okay. So what do you, do you not drink the water? Because you're worried about the safety or the ",21
300,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewer,color? ,22
291,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewee,The color you know [inaudible; likely “Mind beyond matter”] type thing ,23
301,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. Does it taste bad or do you?  ,24
292,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewee,I’ve never drank it. ,25
302,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewer,You've never tried it? ,26
293,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewee,"Never tried it. When I saw our water tank, uh no. ",27
303,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. Now what about so you get water delivered?  ,28
294,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewee,Yep.  ,29
304,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewer,What does that look like? Kind of how often?  ,30
295,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewee,We have it every two weeks. Every other Wednesday we get it delivered. Since I had my new tank put ,31
296,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewee,"in, and it’s been about three weeks now and I've had to replace the filter three times.  ",32
305,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewer,Okay. ,33
297,April 22,Interview 11 ,78,1,Interviewee,Yeah. Just turns orange. ,34
317,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. Do you ever run out of water before your next delivery? ,35
306,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,"Just after I moved here, we ran out one time and turned out because they didn't deliver water. I mean, ",36
307,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,"they didn't fill it up all the way. The reason I discovered that is because the following fill, I noticed the ",37
308,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,tank wasn't always full. And we've never run out of water since then.  ,38
318,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay.  ,39
309,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,I don't know if they ran out water in their truck. Maybe they just quit or what? ,40
319,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay, so generally you don't but sometimes you run out of water? ",41
310,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,"Right, yeah. ",42
320,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewer,What do you do? What did you do when you ran out of water? ,43
311,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,I had to go down to the plant with totes and jugs and buckets to get water. ,44
321,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay.  ,45
312,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,Middle of where. Freezing. I was not a happy man. My wife was just getting in the shower and also no ,46
313,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,"water. Oh, yeah. ",47
322,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh, that's rough. Okay. And okay, so you're on hauled water? Yeah, some of the city’s on piped ",48
323,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewer,water. Would you prefer piped? ,49
314,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,"Probably more consistent, you know? What might be a little bit more if you had like, purpose, like you ",50
315,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,need a garden hose. You'd have a garden or we have a yard. And I have to haul water buckets from ,51
316,April 22,Interview 11 ,79,1,Interviewee,the rain bucket just to water my lawn. ,52
334,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. So just like the quantity of water would be nice for piped. ,53
324,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,Right.  ,54
335,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. And so what would you change about your water system? ,55
325,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,The filtration probably. ,56
336,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewer,Okay. Yeah. So better water that's getting delivered or your house? ,57
326,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,"No. Getting delivered. Because obviously, you know, if it's coming out of the tank, the brand new poly ",58
327,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,"tank, then you've got rust on my pipes or plastic my house. Or copper and copper don’t rust ",59
337,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Better quality.  ,60
328,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,61
338,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewer,And then you might drink it. If you are more confident in the quality.  ,62
329,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,63
339,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewer,Okay. That makes sense. Is there anything you like about your water systems particularly?  ,64
330,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,No. ,65
340,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, I guess it's different coming from [REDACTED] as well. ",66
331,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,Yeah. There we take water for granted. Of course it being good drinking water. But we take water for ,67
332,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,"granted there. But now living here, you know you're more conservative. Living up here you kind of train ",68
333,April 22,Interview 11 ,80,1,Interviewee,"your mind, hey wait a minute you need to conserve your water, it’s not a renewable resource.  ",69
349,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah.  ,70
341,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewee,So definitely that's one good positive thing about moving up here. Learn to be frugal here. ,71
350,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,You think a little bit more about water?  ,72
342,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,73
351,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's what I always I talk to people a lot about, you know, you don't really think about your water ",74
352,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,"when it just always comes out of the tap. And it tastes good. And you could drink it. So yeah, I think that ",75
353,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,realization and being a little more cognitive of that. ,76
343,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. Down there, you take long showers you want until hot water runs out. Here, get wet, turn it off. ",77
344,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewee,"Soap up, get wet, rinse off. You know. ",78
354,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, like quick, just clean yourself. It's not a relaxing. ",79
345,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewee,"Right, exactly. ",80
355,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,And then what about the cost of water? Is it? Is it something that you is a burden? Or how do you? ,81
346,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewee,"Well, it's more than I’m used to paying. I'm used to paying 300 a year, now we pay like 300 a month, ",82
347,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewee,"250 – 300 a month something like that. So I mean, it's a big increase you know from what I’m used to. ",83
356,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,Yeah. That's a larger chunk of your money you're spending toward water. ,84
348,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewee,"But you’re making more here than you do there though. So I mean, it's kinda pay off.  ",85
357,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,Okay. That makes sense. What about maintaining your system? Do you like do you have freeze up? Is ,86
358,April 22,Interview 11 ,81,1,Interviewer,there anything that happens along those lines. ,87
359,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,"No, I've never had a freeze up with my system, because all my plumbing is inside the house. And it's ",88
360,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,open to the heat. ,89
369,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewer,I got it all tangled. Sorry. ,90
361,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,I don't have to worry about freeze up on my water at all.  ,91
370,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. Is your tank inside too?  ,92
362,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. Yes, in the bathroom.  ",93
371,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewer,Okay.  ,94
363,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,"And so like I say, I have to now I can keep on my water easier before I put a stick in there to kind of see ",95
364,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,where my water level was.  ,96
372,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewer,Yeah. ,97
365,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,"I mean, it's everything's rusty and.. ",98
373,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewer,You have like the donut tank now? ,99
366,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,Yeah.  ,100
374,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewer,"Okay. They kinda look like donuts, the plastic ones. ",101
367,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. Two things. I have a 500 gallon one, which looks like exactly a donut and then I have just a ",102
368,April 22,Interview 11 ,82,1,Interviewee,regular 200 gallon cylinder one. ,103
384,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewer,"Okay, got it. Got it. And so you haven't had really a lot of challenges in terms of like your water system ",104
385,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewer,and maintaining it. ,105
375,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewee,No. Uh-uh (negative) ,106
386,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewer,"It’s pretty simple. Yeah, okay. That’s great. ",107
376,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewee,Yeah. You change the filter maybe once a month because it does get dirty so fast. ,108
387,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. Yeah.  ,109
377,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewee,"You change them every three months, but either that or it comes out black.  ",110
388,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewer,Wow.  ,111
378,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewee,"I learned that the hard way. For some I changed the filter, it was full black. ",112
389,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewer,Do you have trouble getting enough filters?  ,113
379,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewee,Say what? ,114
390,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewer,Do you have trouble getting enough filters or your always?  ,115
380,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewee,Amazon. ,116
391,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewer,"Okay, perfect. Perfect. And then what about seasonally? Is there any water challenges that are only ",117
392,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewer,present during the winter or summer? ,118
381,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewee,"I don’t see any. Just like I say, it’s delivered. So the only problem we might have is if they don't deliver ",119
382,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewee,to you. I did run across that this last Wednesday. I'm every Wednesday. When they didn’t deliver water ,120
383,April 22,Interview 11 ,83,1,Interviewee,"Wednesday, and so I call, it was after hours. So I called them, I said. They said it was $350. I said no it ",121
393,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewee,ain’t. I said my delivery is today. It's not my fault you didn’t deliver. It's your guys's fault. And they find ,122
394,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewee,"you on the front delivering water. But, you know, it's not my fault. ",123
401,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewer,"I mean, if you said it's a hard job, so it's probably a little short. ",124
395,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewee,"And they have a hard time getting, well every business has had a hard time getting employees. I work ",125
396,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewee,"for the [REDACTED], and nobody wants to work. ",126
402,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewer,"It’s hard to get employees. Okay. And so some of the like, I guess disruptions are are just more. Not ",127
403,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewer,"enough drivers, they weren’t table to deliver to everyone. ",128
397,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewee,That's the biggest issue the city has is not enough drivers. I mean they spend [REDACTED] an hour for ,129
398,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewee,part time drivers. ,130
404,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. I saw the posting at the grocery store.  ,131
399,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,132
405,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewer,So. Okay. So that was the last question I had. But is there anything I should have asked you that I ,133
406,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewer,didn't? ,134
400,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewee,"No, I think we’ve talking about everything.  ",135
407,April 22,Interview 11 ,84,1,Interviewer,"Okay, awesome. Well, I'll pause this. ",136
418,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewer,"Okay, I have this going. Yes, so well tell me a little bit more about about though. ",1
408,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee,"When was that? That was back early 2000s, and we had gotten our new water plant treatment. And ",2
409,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee,and so they took the sample and sent it to I think it was [REDACTED]. And then we got the best tap ,3
410,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee,water for rural community. Of the whole nation.  ,4
419,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewer,Wow. What village were you in? ,5
411,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee, [REDACTED; Introductions]. ,6
420,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay, well, so can you tell me a little more about kind of what you like about your water system? ",7
421,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewer,"Well, maybe it was, let’s back up, how did you receive water in both when you lived in [REDACTED] ",8
422,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewer,and in the village? ,9
412,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee,"The village it was actually, well, it depends on what house I lived in. One house we had part of it would ",10
413,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee,be rain collected off the it would come in off the roof and go into a tank and then also they would take a ,11
414,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee,hose from the school system and then also fill it up when there wasn't rainwater. And then when I ,12
415,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee,moved into the new housing we had piped water. ,13
423,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewer,"Oh. Okay, in the village.  ",14
416,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee,Yeah. ,15
424,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewer,"Okay. When you have rainwater, was there treatment before it got to the house?  ",16
417,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewee,No.  ,17
425,April 22,Interview 12 ,85,2,Interviewer,"Okay, so just natural rainwater. What did you did you like the taste of one of them better like, or? ",18
426,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,"I have a well at my house in [REDACTED]. So, I actually liked the village water. ",19
438,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewer,"Okay, yeah tastes like a little bit more.  ",20
427,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, it would have been similar to my system probably at the house because they would collect it. And ",21
428,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,then they would put it through the treatment plant and then pipe it into and we had water tanks that they ,22
429,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,would store it in so that water tanks also collected water. ,23
439,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. And then, so then now in [REDACTED] are you on piped or hauled? ",24
430,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,Hauled system.  ,25
440,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewer,"Hauled, okay. What do you think about that? ",26
431,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,"I think it would be good water, but I think my piping in my house is the suspect. I don't think it's the ",27
432,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,"water coming from. So, I have to show my system is like boil for coffee or tea. Okay, and then in the ",28
433,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,"morning when it's cool, I'll put it in the pitcher. ",29
441,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. Do you have a filter as well?  ",30
434,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, well, yeah, that's what I mean. I put it through a filter pitcher.  ",31
442,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewer,"Okay, and then you still boil it?  ",32
435,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,I still boil it before because I just I don't know. ,33
443,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewer,You just don’t think it’ll –  ,34
436,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,"Well, when I look at what's like I get really a lot of scum around like in the toilet and if my dishwater sits ",35
437,April 22,Interview 12 ,86,1,Interviewee,overnight like if I want to soak something and so that's why I do it.  ,36
461,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, the color. ",37
444,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"It's more like I don't Yeah, it's like the color but the scuff I’ve got like you just you can't get you can't like. ",38
462,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. So it just kind of like doesn't look like it? ",39
445,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, it’s always safe to boil all you water.  ",40
463,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewer,"Yes. Yeah, exactly.  ",41
446,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"So, after you boil it and then put it through the pitcher.  ",42
464,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewer,Do you drink bottled water? Or do you just? ,43
447,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,I try to stay away from bottled water because [inaudible] and so I don't like it's especially out here ,44
448,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"there's no place to really recycle I mean it's harder to recycle. So, I try to stay away from that. So, like ",45
449,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"my house in  [REDACTED], we have the filter in the refrigerator the water coming out of the refrigerator ",46
450,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"and stuff. So, I try to get their hands, now if we go on a trip, yeah, I always resort for the bottle water ",47
451,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"cuz you don't want to get some water that might get your system out of whack. Okay, and my dog ",48
452,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"always drinks, and if we have our dog with us, we always make sure he has the bottle water too, so. ",49
465,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewer,"Oh yeah, [REDACTED]. ",50
466,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewer,"Okay, so how do you how do you use water in your household? We kind of already talked about it is it? ",51
453,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"So, I get 300 gallons every two weeks so that's my water to do everything showers and dishes and ",52
454,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,laundry. So I have a washer and dryer there. But what I did find like and I did find that it helps my water ,53
455,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"in the in the in the toilet like it kept stuff down in the toilet and made it cleaner, was um I had frozen ",54
456,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"pipes and so I had to collect the water from the washer into like a big tub. And I went, Okay, I held ",55
457,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"before I paid to do it before and I hauled it into the, you know, like, put it down the sink or the bathtub. ",56
458,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"And I went, I can save water. I mean, I’m such the village girl because we used to have to like, have it ",57
459,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"hauled like a pipe like, we used to have to go like, okay I need some water. So, we were very cautious ",58
460,April 22,Interview 12 ,87,1,Interviewee,"about what we use. And so I just took a dip pan and we just put it in the toilet like, many a times, you ",59
467,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"know, you have a storm. You're out. We all know how to do that. And I noticed that actually kept it ",60
468,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,cleaner. ,61
483,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. Okay. ",62
469,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"One laundry detergent is better than the other, by the way. ",63
484,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewer,"So, okay, so you mentioned kind of your village girl, you're used to conserving water. Can you expand ",64
485,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewer,a little more on what that was like living in the village of water use? ,65
470,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"So, in the village, our water would be stored in a tank. And that was our water once a once the line ",66
471,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"froze up to be able to pipe in more. It was like that was it for the [REDACTED]. That was it. And so, ",67
472,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"there was times like one load of laundry a week. Instead of our normal two to three, and like, don't take ",68
473,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,as many showers and trying to get people – I grew up camping. And they used to notice like the ,69
474,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,maintenance guys would say this isn't bad for you as much as it goes. This is luxurious camping. I ,70
475,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"could have bad, you know, bad. It's like being in a like a motorhome or something. Because you could ",71
476,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"still use the facility, you could still use the drains and everything. But you had no water to pump. So, like ",72
477,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"I tried to teach the [REDACTED] how to do like, I took a wastebasket filled it up with water, boiled some ",73
478,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"water, made a nice temperate thing. You know, rinse my hair. Put it in there to get it wet. Let it drain ",74
479,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"back in wash it up and drain. And I kept hand – like the wit, you know, the movie witness?  ",75
486,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewer,"Oh, yeah. Yup. ",76
480,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"Where she’s, [REDACTED]. Yeah. It's just the witness shower, you know? And they, they just were ",77
481,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,"like, but I can't be in the bathtub. And it's not our drains, it’s the water.  ",78
487,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewer,"So, would you rather -   ",79
482,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewee,And you could use very little water when you do stuff like that.  ,80
488,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Would you ever run out for drinking in the village? Or would you use because it was during the ,81
489,April 22,Interview 12 ,88,1,Interviewer,winter it seems right? When it was freezing? ,82
490,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"It was really nice that we would get a strong wind from Japan, we'd get that. I forget what they call the ",83
491,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,stream. And it would warm up. And then as soon as it would get anywhere where they could safely ,84
492,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"pump the water without it freezing, because we had like fire hoses so you can't let them freeze. And ",85
493,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"they would try to fill up. And a couple of times we got that break where we went, yay. And then just the ",86
494,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,conserving of the water. But it was also cool when they built a new school. They actually used the raw ,87
495,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,water to flush the system to flush the toilet. Really a lot of people were like because that would be ,88
496,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,greywater. Because it came from the washer and dryer that was in school for the school use and for ,89
497,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] that didn't have access to it in their house. And then from like the kitchen, and any – you ",90
498,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"know how graywater system works. And it really took them to get used to that it's okay, that is grey ",91
499,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,water and that it actually helped us conserve and we can use more water. So that was nice to see that ,92
500,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,that they built that conservatory into the school.  ,93
516,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewer,Yeah. And so what would you change about water services and you can talk about the village and ,94
517,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED]. ,95
501,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] I would like it if they would have like, you could get a kit to make sure your water was ",96
502,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"safe. You know whether it's your pipes or what their piping it. Cuz you know, cuz we're all like storing in ",97
503,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"a tank like right now mine's in a metal tank, and I think I would rather go for the plastic but then again it ",98
504,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,can it break down some of the plastic and put some of that you know it's like. But I think that and maybe ,99
505,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,being able to get filtered better because I do have a filter system but it's hard like I don't change it ,100
506,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,because they get shut off the pump and all of that so my maintenance guy will do it. But they can't ,101
507,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,always get them. I think that's the biggest thing is I think we need a testing.  ,102
518,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewer,"Okay, what about would you rather have piped water? ",103
508,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,They actually are we're on the schedule. I don't know when it's gonna happen. But I saw something ,104
509,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,come through that they're going to set that were scheduled down and I'm on [REDACTED] to get the ,105
510,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,pipe. Where that is and I know things always say they say three years and it takes ten years. ,106
519,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Are you excited, or? ",107
511,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"I don't use it much. It's just me. So, I mean, I'm always cautious of it. Like I go home, and I, when I, ",108
512,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,when my daughter puts a pipe in my house and I had to replace my shower. It was cheaper for me just ,109
513,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"to tile. And so I read, like, I don't like that jacuzzi tub that came with the house. So, I'm gonna replace it. ",110
514,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,"And it has 100 gallons, and I'm using the hard for me to do that. And I'm on a well with like a good ",111
515,April 22,Interview 12 ,89,1,Interviewee,water water thing crashed it and came in there too. [REDACTED] ,112
538,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewer,"So, you've mentioned a couple times, freeze up and maintenance. Can you expand a little bit on kind of ",113
539,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewer,what you have to do to take care of your water system? ,114
520,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"So, the new maintenance guy we got, who it’s his full time job and not like his part time job. And he's ",115
521,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,very [inaudible] and says he got underneath my house and found out that the heating tape was broke. ,116
522,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"Do it wasn't, it wasn't keeping, although I had it plugged in, it wasn't heating all the pipes. So, I haven't ",117
523,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,had any problems since the fix. ,118
540,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewer,"Okay, so you have someone regularly kind of checking.  ",119
524,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, he comes out and says, yeah, he'll check in with us because he's usually there's like, six little ",120
525,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"mini houses where I live. And yeah, so he'll check. And then in the winter, we have these big huge ",121
526,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"heating, like it looks like a steel cylinder. And then you put it in your tank and keep it from like, a few ",122
527,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"days before that, you know, you're gonna get hauled out that it will thaw anything that needs to be ",123
528,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,thawed.  ,124
541,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay. And then, let me see if I asked most of my – ",125
529,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"I think you got, yeah, I think you got a little bit more when I went off on the fracking, but – ",126
542,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewer,"Oh, no, no, I love stories and stuff. That was not. So, is there any improvements you would like to see ",127
543,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewer,that I didn't ask you about already? ,128
530,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"No, actually. I mean, I understand where we live. I've been in this area for 18 years. I think the biggest ",129
531,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"thing is that if we have concerns, I think the city should have some testing kits for us, even if they're ",130
532,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"available for a couple bucks. And that's the big thing is like, where do you send it? Because like, I've ",131
533,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"been, like, when I've been home at Lowe's, I can buy a test. And it has a place I can send it. But they ",132
534,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"kept saying, I don't know. Will it work if you send it from? ",133
544,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewer,"Farther away. Yeah. Okay. And then what about like, your water bill? Is it really expensive? Is it ",134
545,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewer,something that's kind of a burden? ,135
535,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"Only if you need an extra haul, extra, the extra that's where they really jack up the price. Which is kind ",136
536,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"of sad because I mean, I'm a [REDACTED], so I'm okay. But when my son came, yeah, just to get an ",137
537,April 22,Interview 12 ,90,1,Interviewee,"extra haul was like, my whole monthly water bill. Yeah, because you gotta get an extra haul, you also ",138
546,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"have to get the extra sewer because they only hold so much, which I get. But that and I think about, ",139
547,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"like, people that live here that like the natives that their family will come in and visit. You can't just say, ",140
548,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"Well, you know, baby wipes. Yeah, yeah, I ",141
564,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, I mean, cuz you want to have your it set to like, the normal amount of people in the home. ",142
549,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, unless they have hauled, or unless they're on the unlimited, because I don't think they monitor ",143
550,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"that. And so, I would like to see that it's not as expensive to get that as it whether it's you just had, you ",144
551,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"know, bad that you want to do the spring cleaning and you want to do all your laundry and stuff. ",145
552,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"Because it's like 10 bucks a load to do laundry at the laundromat, and then it's hard to get in and then ",146
553,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,they're not always you know how it is with laundromats.  ,147
565,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, it’s $10. It’s not the like dollar you put in that? ",148
554,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"No, and even back home. Because my, you know, your washer and dryer will go [inaudible; likely ",149
555,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"“broke”]. And then you gotta wait for it to repair replace. Or when I'm on vacation. Yeah, I spend no ",150
556,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"more than I think the most I've ever had seen is like, $4 a load. Which I get. We're here. It's always ",151
557,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"gonna be more expensive. But it's not always an I mean, that's a big expense for our family.  ",152
566,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's really expensive. Yeah. ",153
558,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"I mean, and I think it's the gatekeeper. I know, when I had a roommate, it was cheaper for me to go and ",154
559,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"workout at the fitness center where I got a free shower, and then I could do laundry. I literally did my ",155
560,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,showering over there and where I could do laundry at home.  ,156
567,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewer,Wow. Yeah. That makes sense. ,157
561,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,"And you know, I get where we live. I mean, I'm not saying that we should become [REDACTED]. I ",158
562,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,understand where we live. But I think that it does put a hardship on certain populations. Especially that ,159
563,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewee,extra haul.  ,160
568,April 22,Interview 12 ,91,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. If you have visitors or anything. Yeah.  ,161
569,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewee,"Because I mean, I know like when we have new [REDACTED], and they don't always have enough ",162
570,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewee,"hotel space here. They'll say, hey, you can 45 bucks, you can stay with another [REDACTED] or family ",163
571,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewee,plan. But you're supposed to give that 45 bucks to them to cover that extra water they might have to ,164
572,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewee,"have. It's $45 a day, so it would eventually. So I mean, that's what the district does to help in that ",165
573,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewee,"situation. And that's $45 a day for water for the extra water, sewer and electric.  ",166
578,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewer,"Wow. Okay, that’s pretty expensive though per day.  ",167
574,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, yeah. I mean, and a lot of times they don't give it to [inaudible]. ",168
579,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewer,"Well, do you have anything else that I didn't ask that you want to share? ",169
575,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewee,"I think the biggest thing is, that's why I was excited.  ",170
580,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewer,"Oh, yeah, I know. That's a great. [REDACTED] ",171
576,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewee,It’s probably because of my background. ,172
581,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewer,It probably is. ,173
577,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,174
582,April 22,Interview 12 ,92,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Well yeah, we'll look into that. And yeah, so I’ll go ahead and pause. ",175
583,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewee,"Sometimes, when it's frozen, we have to use the clean, clean, clean from lake. ",1
591,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewer,Yeah. ,2
584,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewee,"And then we use it for washing, drinking. Use it for cleaning, washing dishes. The summertime we use ",3
585,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewee,the [inaudible; likely “safe”] water.  ,4
592,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewer,Yeah. ,5

587,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewee,"They have that, uh, we pay $2 a gallon and then we use it for drinking cuz it’s safe. ",8
594,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewer,Okay great so you go to like a laundromat or? ,9
588,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewee,Laundromat. Yeah.  ,10

596,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, and then you take it back to your house?  ",13
590,April 22,Interview 13 ,93,2,Interviewee,"Yeah, yeah. Use it for washing dishes or steam baths. Use that water. ",14

1004,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewer,So what are some of the things that you like about your water system? What are some of the things ,68
1005,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewer,that you? ,69
993,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,There’s not much that I like about it right now because there’s a lot of work involved and a lot of ,70
994,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,preparation to make it drinkable. ,71
1006,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewer,And so if you could change something about the structure of it. what would you what would be the ,72
1007,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewer,things you'd like to change? ,73
995,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,I’d like to see central community watering point where everybody will have access to that or you want a ,74
996,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,delivery to come in and deliver like a private person can come in and deliver for them. And capital ,75
997,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,projects could include everybody to fix their water and sewer cuz right now it’s kinda like I have to ,76
998,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,[inaudible]. Another village somewhere else is probably worse out there dumping honey buckets ,77
999,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,outside of their house. ,78
1008,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewer,Oh no. Okay. So more and more kind of piped infrastructure? ,79
1000,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,Yeah. [inaudible].  ,80
1009,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewer,For that central point would it be like everyone comes to get their water from the central point? ,81
1001,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,Yeah. Either that or like a person can fill their tank and deliver. ,82
1010,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewer,So currently the people who are delivering to – is that city or? ,83
1002,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,[inaudible; likely “yes”] ,84
1011,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewer,"It’s the city, okay. ",85
1003,April 22,Interview 17 ,119,1,Interviewee,"And they ran of their [inaudible; “unlimited and they’re crippled”], so now they’re not delivering anything. ",86
1022,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewer,At all right now at all. So you're getting all of your water right now from the wells. So that's what do you– ,87
1023,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewer,day to day what's your biggest use of water?  ,88
1012,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,Drinking and cleaning. Drinking coffee and making dinner and whatever. ,89
1024,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewer,Do you feel like what you do you feel like how you use it today is you've got enough for you? Or it feels ,90
1025,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewer,stressful? ,91
1013,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,It’s getting stressful for a lot of people who have kids or bigger families. Like they don’t have the time to ,92
1014,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,go [inaudible]. ,93
1026,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that’s hard. Well, is there anything? That's all questions I have. Is there anything else that you ",94
1027,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewer,want to tell stories that you want to share?  ,95
1015,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,"In Alaska, in this area, there’s always been problems with water and sewer. And maintenance, ",96
1016,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,"maintenance is a problem. Finding someone to fix those and a lot of low-income people, they can’t ",97
1017,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,even afford parts for their utilities. ,98
1028,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewer,Do you think it'll get better if it's always been like this? ,99
1018,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,"We see some progress, water and sewer progress in a few villages, and only way to improve is if that ",100
1019,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,"person has income to pay for it. Where if you don’t have income to pay for it, then just turn them off. ",101
1020,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,And 90% are some of the people are [inaudible; likely “unemployed”] in the village and they go by ,102
1021,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewee,public assistance or. Very small handful who do have income. ,103
1029,April 22,Interview 17 ,120,1,Interviewer,Yeah that’s really hard.  ,104
1055,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewer,"That's great. Okay, so it looks like we're recording. So first, can you just tell me a little bit about ",1
1056,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewer,"yourself, your name and where you're from and what you’re doing here? ",2
1030,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"[REDACTED; Introductions] And I'm on the delivery water system versus use all-you-want system. So, ",3
1031,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"I'm, I'm kind of noticing a difference with that. You know, it'd be great if everybody could be on the ",4
1032,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"deliver – on the regular system, free flow system so that they can use all the water that they want. Their ",5
1033,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"water needs and their sewer needs met without having to have it hauled. And, and one of the things ",6
1034,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"that I’ve seen more of this time that I never saw before because I wasn't exposed to it, but so systems ",7
1035,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"freezing, so that emptying them is impossible. You know, and it's usually in the neck. So that the tank ",8
1036,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"isn’t frozen, but it still can’t be emptied. Which, you know, I mean, creates problems if you can't work ",9
1037,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"through the tank. It either breaks overflows or backsides. And it's not a healthy system, just in that in ",10
1038,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,that aspect alone. Not a healthy system. ,11
1057,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewer,"Yeah. So, have you had that issue in your in your home? ",12
1039,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"Uh, yes, we did, and I was gone. So, when it first happened, so when I got back, I was a little bit ",13
1040,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"oblivious to it because my housemates were not changing their, what was going on? And I'm like, ",14
1041,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"scratching my head and saying to my houseowner, my homeowner, [inaudible] sewers that were ",15
1042,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"running over because ours was, and it was [inaudible]. And she goes, there’s no big problem here. I’m ",16
1043,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"like, uhh why not. It’s a problem any place else. If you have E coli or any of those other sewer problems ",17
1044,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"when there's a break in the sewer anyplace else it’s a problem, so why isn’t there a problem here. And ",18
1045,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"it was because she chose not to deal with it, so therefore, it wasn’t a problem. Or is it because that's ",19
1046,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,the [inaudible]. And I don’t know the answer to that. I don’t. I would hope that’s not the acceptable ,20
1047,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"behavior. And even in the villages there are sewer systems, and those villages that don’t have sewer ",21
1048,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"systems. They have a [inaudible] system, and so it doesn’t make sense to me that it’s [inaudible] in the ",22
1049,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,village [inaudible]. ,23
1058,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewer,"So, if you could change how your system works, how would you change it? What do you think could be ",24
1059,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewer,done to improve it? ,25
1050,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"Well, I hope and I think, I don’t know, but I think that [REDACTED] is attempting to get running water ",26
1051,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"sewer to the whole of uh city. They've got some distance uh, suburbs that are subdivisions that almost ",27
1052,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,"prevent that just because of their location and how far they are away. You know, just think about the ",28
1053,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,main part of the city and to free flow their water sewer system over I'm sure with lots of problems on the ,29
1054,April 22,Interview 18 ,121,2,Interviewee,way. But I also know that they have a lot of problems with the what they have in the free flowing. And ,30
1060,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,part of it is because of the tundra bulges and things like that. I mean those kinds of things are in ,31
1061,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,freezing and above water lines I mean well above ground water ,32
1083,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Surface. ,33
1062,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"Above surface, there you go. Above surface lines, you know the freezing in the wintertime but the ",34
1063,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"tundra bulges and sinks and different things like that. It’s part of, part of living here, but it’s really part of ",35
1064,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,the challenge to get full running water and sewer to everybody. It just is. And that’s another reason that ,36
1065,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,it’s not only the distance but it’s those kinds of things that are preventative in getting to the subdivisions ,37
1066,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"is that, you know, there miles from town and part of the reason they’re there versus right next to it is ",38
1067,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,because to the wetlands are preventative. I mean you can’t haul enough dirt in to cover up a wetland ,39
1068,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,that [inaudible; likely “close”] to China  ,40
1084,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewer,Yeah a lot of environmental factors happening.  ,41
1069,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,I'm sorry?  ,42
1085,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewer,A lot of environmental factors that are preventative.  ,43
1070,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,There are. Yeah. Yeah. ,44
1086,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewer,"So, on the system that you have at home you know other than water so if you're if your sewer part of it ",45
1087,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewer,is frozen a little bit of that is wait and wait until the next week when they can service it? ,46
1071,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"No you can call for you know the actual tech to come out. I think there’s a fee to it, but there's work ",47
1072,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"involved. First you have to plug it in, so that it thaws. And then you have to pay attention to that and ",48
1073,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"make sure that as soon as it’s thawed, that you get ahold of the city and tell them, my system is thawed ",49
1074,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"will you send a truck and empty. And I know that one of the neighbors that belongs to the church there, ",50
1075,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"theirs had had frozen earlier. When they talked about, they talked about what they did to help it thaw ",51
1076,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"faster, so they got it thawed within a day. When I got back home, my extension cord that I use for my ",52
1077,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,car was plugged into the system set up as the heating system to thaw it. And but I don’t know how long ,53
1078,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"it had been there. I you know I was like one of the one of the gals was like, see yeah the sewer systems ",54
1079,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"been frozen. It’s been frozen, okay, what does that mean. They said yeah, I saw my extension cord ",55
1080,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"was moved. Oh yeah yours was out so we just used it. You know, just some but no other comments ",56
1081,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"about this is what we’re doing until we, or we’ve already got it emptied or anything like that. And it was ",57
1082,April 22,Interview 18 ,122,1,Interviewee,"said in such a passing way that I didn’t say, hey wait a minute what’s going on. I was passing that ",58
1088,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,1,Interviewee,person was passing and headed on to the next thing that we felt was so important in our lives. No time ,59
1089,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,1,Interviewee,to stop and talk.  ,60
1090,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,1,Interviewer,"Right, right. Okay. So, if something does break, so with the thawing that’s something that you guys ",61
1091,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,1,Interviewer,"handled, but if there's something else that breaks, is that something that you handle? Or is that ",62
1092,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,1,Interviewer,something that you have to make a call? Who fixes these things? ,63
1093,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"Well this is, yeah, see so at Christmas time because the other two people are teachers they were going ",64
1094,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"to the lower 48 for Christmas. And I heard this, so in conversation with other people, I was hearing that ",65
1095,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,they're more interested in putting pads down and putting homes on pads instead of pillars. Our homes ,66
1096,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"on pillars and, and I'm like, seriously. I'm not an engineer but that didn't make sense to me. Because of ",67
1097,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"the heaves and the gives and the all of that. And, and so I I said, ‘oh that's interesting how come,’ and ",68
1098,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"they said, ‘well because sometimes the heaves will push a pillar up through. And at Christmas time ",69
1099,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"when I was there by myself, I heard this really loud bang under the kitchen corner where the sink is. ",70
1100,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"And I thought, oh no surely don't please don't tell me that’s a pillar coming through and so I went and ",71
1101,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,looked and everything looked kosher everything was you know like level and everything and I'm like ,72
1102,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,*sighs*.  ,73
1103,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,Well the in January we had kind of a thawing period where the temperatures were even the night ,74
1104,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"temperatures were above freezing, and the kitchen sink is like in the north corner. I saw dripping ",75
1105,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,coming from under the house on the south corner directly south of the kitchen sink. So I told the ,76
1106,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"landowner and I was like, I don’t know, you know I didn’t. I reported what I saw; I felt like that was my ",77
1107,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"responsibility. And then been thinking about it, you know, kind of like should you do anything, why didn’t ",78
1108,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"you do something, you know, those kinds of things. And then it kind of processed that I was like well ",79
1109,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,you can’t do anything until your- because you have to pull probably pull the insulation off the bottom of ,80
1110,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"the house, the spray insulation of the bottom of the house. You know all the floor joists are sprayed all ",81
1111,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"the pipes are inside that, contained. So, it’s all insulated. So, if you can't, you can't go that often. You ",82
1112,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"know, not when you got minus 40 Windchill? Or even minus 30 ambient, you can’t expose the floor, the ",83
1113,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"pipes, and everything else.  ",84
1117,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, you'd have a lot more problems.  ",85
1114,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"So, so it was like because you can't reinsulate. It’s too cold to reinsulate. So, you have to wait. So, you ",86
1115,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"know with everything coming now we’re getting kinda excited. Above freezing nice and up to 50, and ",87
1116,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewee,"this next week it’s like, ‘whoo.’ I’m from [REDACTED]. They’re already planting corn. ",88
1118,April 22,Interview 18 ,123,2,Interviewer,Yeah [REDACTED].  ,89
1119,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,And you get really strange looks when you have your winter coat on your carry on getting on the plane. ,90
1120,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"It’s like who are you, I don’t have any idea where I’m going. ",91
1145,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah.  ",92
1121,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"But yeah, so you know the challenges worth without. You know, getting that, how much sewer is ",93
1122,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"collected. How much kitchen water is collected. And the insulation and the floor [inaudible]. You know, ",94
1123,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"another question. I mean another comment. I'm thinking about that, it made me think about her other ",95
1124,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"comment about the sewer systems being frozen and she said, when I asked her about the  ",96
1125,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] thing, she goes, ‘Oh, it's no problem. All of that all of the solid stuff drops to the bottom. ",97
1126,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"It's just like it’s just like, grey water.’ I’m like, I know you’re not a [REDACTED]. ",98
1146,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewer,Let’s talk about sanitation. Yeah. ,99
1127,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. So, I just, you know, I mean, to me that was for kinda answer and attitude about her thoughts ",100
1128,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"about it. You know so, she just kind of brushed it off like it wasn't important to her, and it’s an important ",101
1129,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,thing. ,102
1147,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. So, do you think that that is something in the community that like, in general, do people know ",103
1148,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewer,"about what they should be doing with their water? Or how things were? I mean, does that feel like it is a ",104
1149,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewer,challenge? ,105
1130,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"I don’t know. I guess there's a part of me that it's like, ‘Okay. How many feathers do I ruffle?’ Especially ",106
1131,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"when I might be the only one that’s really concerned about it. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. Am I ",107
1132,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,the only one that’s really concerned about it? Or are there other people concerned about it? They just ,108
1133,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"didn’t know about it. You know, except that it's not an uncommon thing. One of my friends is on the ",109
1134,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,truck driver system for the water and sewer. And so he was over to the house to bring the new water ,110
1135,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"connector, a pipe a hose connector onto our water intake pipe. And so I ask him about. You know I’m ",111
1136,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"like because it was still that same time frame. And I asked him about it. And he said, Well, obviously, ",112
1137,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,you guys had that sewer overflow look how black the puddle of water is that’s around that. You know a ,113
1138,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"puddle that was being built by the melting snow and ice. And he and it was like, obviously, that's what it ",114
1139,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"is. But I’m like, you know, I didn't think about it at the time, but you know, I'm thinking about it now. Is ",115
1140,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"that something that- because he didn't seem too excited about it. He didn’t say, hey why don’t you ",116
1141,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"come over and get [inaudible]. Get something done about it. [inaudible]. And you know it’s just like, ",117
1142,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"yeah you know. Give it a thought and call for a truck, was kind of his comment. And maybe because he, ",118
1143,April 22,Interview 18 ,124,1,Interviewee,"I mean I don’t know him really really really well. But I think that maybe his thinking was, well, she knows ",119

1163,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewer,Right. Panicking isn’t gonna help so. ,121
1150,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,"Right. You know if it was somebody that he didn't trust to get things done, then he may have been a ",122
1151,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,"little more assertive with his comments and stuff like that. Unfortunately, it’s not my monkey. I don’t own ",123
1152,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,it. ,124
1164,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Uh-huh. ,125
1153,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,"And therefore, can’t. You know, it's not that I wouldn’t. It’s that I can’t. ",126
1165,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's a tough challenge. You're not the, you don’t own the thing that is keeping you healthy. ",127
1154,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. I’ve done all that I could’ve done. I had commented about what scuffles take on them. I mean, ",128
1155,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,"you know, I mean, that was kind of a nice way of saying [inaudible]. Top of the ground. Without using ",129
1156,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,those words. ,130
1166,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewer,"Right. Yeah. As far as your drinking water, so the water will get delivered to your home and do you ",131
1167,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewer,have anything between when it gets delivered and when you're drinking it or when you're showering ,132
1168,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewer,with it? ,133
1157,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,"Between showering, laundry, toilets, you know, there’s nothing between that I’m familiar or aware of. ",134
1158,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,But we do have filters. We have zero water container filter system. And the owner and I use [inaudible] ,135
1169,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewer,Like a Brita? ,136
1159,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,Brita. ,137
1170,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewer,"There's quite a few different brands, but that's a pretty typical one. ",138
1160,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, and I don’t know about the Brita compared to the zero water system. Oh the zero water system ",139
1161,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,"has the tester on it. And so, one day, just, you know, she's like tell us tell us, this is the tester, test it in ",140
1162,April 22,Interview 18 ,125,1,Interviewee,"that right now, because we she was also getting five gallon bottles delivered. And she wasn’t real ",141
1171,April 22,Interview 18 ,126,1,Interviewee,"happy with that. And so, I tested the zero, our zero system, and then I tested the delivery one. And they ",142
1172,April 22,Interview 18 ,126,1,Interviewee,were both five on that zero system. And so she had ordered some filters and changed them out one ,143
1173,April 22,Interview 18 ,126,1,Interviewee,"day when I was out of the house. I was like, it doesn’t sound too bad. 120 compared to a 120 to 5. 5’s ",144
1174,April 22,Interview 18 ,126,1,Interviewee,"not bad, but she wanted that the zero system. ",145
1175,April 22,Interview 18 ,126,1,Interviewer,All right. Is there anything that I didn't ask you that you want to talk about? Or do you have any ,146
1176,April 22,Interview 18 ,126,1,Interviewer,questions for me? [REDACTED] ,147
1177,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"So they’re having all these barges forever since barges been coming to [REDACTED], and if you go up ",1
1178,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"steamboat because they take people in the summer on kayak tours, and there's at least ten old barges ",2
1179,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,in there and they're rusted and they used to carry some of them carried fuel. So this is contaminating ,3
1180,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"not only the drinking water, but the fish. And then people just say, ‘Oh, no, it isn't.’ But it is. And then in ",4
1181,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"the summer, they want to open  [REDACTED], which uses arsenic to put the, anyway. ",5
1196,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewer,So your worried about like the natural water?  ,6
1182,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"It's just gonna get contaminated, and then the only water we're going to be able to purchase is the ",7
1183,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"water that's having to be circulated in some filtration, which would be costly. And so you're gonna pay ",8
1184,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"more for water. You do pay more for water in [REDACTED] than you pay for a gallon of gas, so it’s very ",9
1185,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"expensive. Unless you go and drink it from the city water, which a lot of people do. They just put filters ",10
1186,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"on theirs, which some people don't. And then if you live in housing, or anywhere where they have city ",11
1187,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"water, it's yellow. Literally. I mean, it's a tinge, maybe not quite as bad as this but you can literally see it ",12
1188,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,and your tub turns yellow. Not from because the iron in it. Not from not cleaning. It would just be logical. ,13
1189,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"But yeah, it's from the from the water.  ",14
1197,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewer,"Are you, do you drink that water then or do you like that water?  ",15
1190,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,Not that water. I drink water from [REDACTED]. From [REDACTED] because they test it.  ,16
1198,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewer,"Yep. Okay, but you don't drink the, what water were you talking about?  ",17
1191,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,In,18
1192,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,the housing. When I go to visit there at somebody who's living there. But they don't have that filter ,19
1193,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"thing. I will say I always bring me a coke. And they say, Oh, you're gonna rot your stomach out. But I'd ",20
1194,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,rather drink a coke than that water. ,21
1199,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, and then water so expensive to buy right like bottled water. Is it cheaper to buy a Coke and bring ",22
1200,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewer,it ,23
1195,April 22,Interview 19 ,127,2,Interviewee,"It’s cheaper than, coke is cheaper. ",24
1215,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Wow. Okay. But you have a filter on your house? ,25
1201,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative).  ,26
1216,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewer,And you drink that? The city of [REDACTED] water? ,27
1202,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, we our water’s delivered in a tank and most people are surprised at least. We used to have a ",28
1203,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,"metal tank, but we wouldn't actually get inside it and clean it out with a brush. Climb in and clean it ",29
1204,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,because it does start to deteriorate. Any water holding tank that you have is gonna get deteriorate or ,30
1205,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,"something because plastic one he says oh, that's better for us. Yeah, but you can see the silt drilling on ",31
1206,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,it.  ,32
1217,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewer,"So at least you know, cuz you're doing metal one, it's harder to see what's going on? ",33
1207,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,34
1218,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Yeah, so you get water delivered to you? ",35
1208,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,"It's very expensive in [REDACTED] to get water delivered. I think it's 15,000 gallon tank and we get it. ",36
1209,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED]. And he only showers once a week. That's just what he does. Oh, well. I like to shower ",37
1210,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,like I have to show every day. I didn't shower before I came today. I just wet my hair because I woke up ,38
1211,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,"late but I hate it not having clean water. I mean, you use water to cook, you use your water to eat, you ",39
1212,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,"know to shower and clean yourself, to clean the house. So, you have to say oh gosh, I guess I’ll wear ",40
1213,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,"this shirt one more day, you know, stuff like that in [REDACTED]. ",41
1219,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewer,"So yeah, do you think would you rather be I know part of [REDACTED] was piped. Would you rather ",42
1220,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewer,have a house that's piped so you're not worried about how much?  ,43
1214,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewee,No. ,44
1221,April 22,Interview 19 ,128,1,Interviewer,Okay. Why is that? ,45
1222,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,The pipe piping systems are very old here and like you know I can see just after we had our plastic ,46
1223,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,"tank, I think it's been two years now, I could see the silt. I'm wondering if there's a pill that they, you ",47
1224,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,purchase and put in there to dissolve that silt because you can't get in this tank like you used to with the ,48
1225,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,metal one. Because we used to climb into that metal you know we get all the clothing going in and ,49
1226,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,clean it and then. ,50
1238,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, make sure yeah. Okay, but But you think that like connected with pipes is? ",51
1227,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,If they put new piping system it's not gonna go through some of the old piping and I wouldn't want to do ,52
1228,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,that. ,53
1239,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewer,"Okay, so you just want would only want new pipes?  ",54
1229,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,55
1240,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewer,Not the ones that are in the? ,56
1230,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,57
1241,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewer,What about I know there's- ,58
1231,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,"Nobody does wells. See when I asked about that because I was living in  [REDACTED], and everybody ",59
1232,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,"there has wells but they said it's over $5,000 to get it dug. And I said that'll be worth it. They said, well, ",60
1233,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,"if you get a well you still have the problem of just the septic tank. So if you use X amount of water, that ",61
1234,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,"septic tank is not. Yeah, so. ",62
1242,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewer,"So, okay, so what would you change about your water service right now? ",63
1235,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,"And I know this is, they are going to be given one, I think $1,700 with the permanent dividend fund. It's ",64
1236,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,"called [REDACTED]. Okay, so they're gonna give that in October. And they're gonna get $1,700 extra ",65
1237,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewee,"for people for water. No, for gas for gas fuel. Because the price of fuel’s going up.  ",66
1243,April 22,Interview 19 ,129,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, but that could help offset your ",67
1244,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, but if they would, for the amount that people pay each month, they should give twice that ",68
1245,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"amount, water shouldn't cost that much. The next thing they will charge us to breathe air clean air. And ",69
1246,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,they do that in Mexico. I think it was in Mexico City. You get paid to go in like a telephone booth type ,70
1247,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,place. Really. And they go pay so much money to go in and breathe clean air.  ,71
1269,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewer,Fresh air. Yeah. Wow.  ,72
1248,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. So yeah, that's, that's what’s changing a lot of things. And people think, oh, it's evolution it’s ",73
1249,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"always gonna change in people's bodies adjust. But pretty soon, we're not going to be able to adjust ",74
1250,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"with all the cancers that were getting from contaminated waters, contaminated foods that have been ",75
1251,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"from the animals getting contaminated plants. You know, so just, it's trickled down and eventually it's ",76
1252,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,going to be too much. A lot of people are gonna move to Alaska because it's one of the least ,77
1253,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"contaminated places. Isn't that funny? We might have to live in a refrigerator, but we're not drinking ",78
1254,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"contaminated water, which is not too much for the down line for everything gets contaminated here, ",79
1255,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,because they're doing mining and strip mining. And when they do that they use that's where they use ,80
1256,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"the arsenic for the gold and break it down, wash it. And they say, Oh, we have this landfill. ",81
1257,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED]. They bought large loads of trash and put it in this thing, and we protested because they ",82
1258,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"said we have this barrier. It's already having problems with deteriorating, it’ll never deteriorate. Now, ",83
1259,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"that was in 1990, and it's already started deteriorating. You know, so people think, oh, yeah, we have ",84
1260,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"this barrier, and it'll be forever. Nothing's forever. Yeah, water is the most powerful element because ",85
1261,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,fire has to be started and air can be contaminated. But water and air both can break. We're downward. ,86
1262,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"We’re down iron. Yeah, so we need water. That is my element, so. ",87
1270,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, I agree. I think it's so important, and that's why we're here. Okay, so I think I asked most of my ",88
1271,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewer,my questions. Did I ask you about taste of the water? ,89
1263,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,When I live in my sister came to visit me in  [REDACTED]. You can actually taste; she didn't like ,90
1264,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,drinking that water. You can taste the water. Just like the sulfur taste in it. Up here the city water you ,91
1265,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"can almost when it first gets delivered, you can smell it in your house, but the water isn’t delivered. You ",92
1266,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"can smell the chlorine. Yeah. So, because it's in the holders tank, but it goes through a filter when it ",93
1267,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,"comes out. We’re not tasting it but yeah, if you drink it cold tastes better. ",94
1272,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewer,Yeah. So you think that the because of your filtration that you have in your house? That's why you feel ,95
1273,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewer,comfortable drinking it?  ,96
1268,April 22,Interview 19 ,130,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,97
1287,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewer,Because you filter it again.  ,98
1274,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,99
1288,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewer,"You wouldn't drink, would you drink the city?  ",100
1275,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, I drink it.  ",101
1289,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewer,"Okay, without your filtration in your house? ",102
1276,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"I went to the movies last night. And I bought popcorn, which I was. I'd never buy a pop there because ",103
1277,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"it's like $5, for this is only $2. So, I get them to give me a cup with ice in it. And she says, Well, we can't ",104
1278,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,give you the filtered water anymore cuz they use it for the [inaudible]. She goes. You can buy water or I ,105
1279,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"can give you tap water. And I know it's from the city. And that's a new building. If it was an old building, ",106
1280,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"I wouldn't go in there. I mean, drink that water. And then the restaurant here, if you're going to be here ",107
1281,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"for any length of time, I wouldn’t do restaurants there. They get haul water delivered to them. Not really ",108
1282,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"cleaning it. It's really gross, and very disgusting. ",109
1290,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewer,"And I mean, so is there a lot of maintenance then? on you for like making sure your tank is clean? And ",110
1283,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, is I was wondering if there was, I'm gonna have to look, research it and find out if there's a pill ",111
1284,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"that I can put in the plastic containers to help clean out that so. Because when we had the other one, ",112
1285,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,we just get in and clean it and that was not every year we go every other year.  ,113
1291,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewer,Okay. Do you have the doughnut looking one?  ,114
1286,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewee,"The one yeah, that this here and it’s got that hole in the middle. Mm-hmm (affirmative).  ",115
1292,April 22,Interview 19 ,131,1,Interviewer,Okay. Yeah.  ,116
1293,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,And a lot of people get way more water than we get delivered because they have more people in their ,117
1294,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"house. It's very expensive to get water here. When I was working with at the city, if you get hooked up ",118
1295,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"and you're a new person, and you're getting delivered water, it was close to $650 just to get your water ",119
1296,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"started. Just for water. That doesn't include your rent, and then the rent is extremely high here, too. ",120
1297,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"They say well, they, they're charging more because he was in Alaska, and everything costs more. And ",121
1298,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"the people get paid a lot anyways. I'm like he would if he didn't charge that much, he wouldn't be paying ",122
1299,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"this much. You don't have to get paid, you know, where is the equalization, you know? At what point do ",123
1300,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"they say enough is enough, especially for water.  ",124
1311,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, I know when it's yeah. So do you ever run out of water before your next deliver? ",125
1301,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"We have run out of water before. Um, there have been times when everything and then I don’t like to ",126
1302,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,do it. We bring our clothing down to the one washing place. They probably filter it. I'm thinking I'm ,127
1303,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"hoping they do because my clothes have not turned yellow, but my mind is thinking, I don’t wanna bring ",128
1304,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,mine down where the piped water is. Isn’t that funny?  ,129
1312,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, you don't want to bring it?  ",130
1305,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"I don't, but I do when I have to if I don't want to run out of water. We've had, we’ve ordered water. So ",131
1306,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"we get it once a month. And some people get it for, you know, once a week. Twice a month we get it. ",132
1307,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,"We'll get it twice, once a week. Or else if they don't want to pay that extra fee because it's expensive, ",133
1308,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,they go and they haul their own water. And they buy it down here. It's like a vending machine you put  ,134
1313,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewer,Okay. At the treatment plant?  ,135
1309,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,Yeah. You put money in and it out spews water.  ,136
1314,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewer,And then you bring it to the house? ,137
1310,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewee,And unload it. ,138
1315,April 22,Interview 19 ,132,1,Interviewer,Have you ever done that? ,139
1316,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"I've never done it. I know people who have, and I've seen people do it when it was like, not even winter. ",140
1317,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"It was like, maybe October. You know, it's chilly. I can't imagine having to be going in December ",141
1318,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,because I was went for a ride with them because I was riding to get to [REDACTED]. You go on a car ,142
1319,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"ride with someone. We're gonna go get water, and it's cold. And I'm thinking, I can't imagine having to ",143
1320,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,do this in December if they run out of water. But you can pay the city extra money to get water ,144
1321,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,delivered to you for a small fee. I think they do a $50 price and I have no idea how much it costs? ,145
1334,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewer,For the extra? Like if you get more? ,146
1322,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"An extra. And what’s so funny, like if I had if I had somebody in my family die, and we have cold water. I ",147
1323,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,call up the city and say we had a death in the family and they know that more people because they ,148
1324,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"gather when when someone dies, they will give you one extra water and one extra sewer for free ",149
1325,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,because they know you're gonna have people there for at least a week. Isn't that crazy? ,150
1335,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay. So, do you conserve a lot? You can so you feel like you have to kind of conserve water, ",151
1336,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewer,right? ,152
1326,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, like yeah. We don't just like out of the faucet. We use a Brita, you know with the little filter and we ",153
1327,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,change that. ,154
1337,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewer,Yeah. But maybe like short. Do you feel like you have to take shorter showers or?  ,155
1328,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"Shorter showers, for sure. It’s crazy. What they call a military shower or short shower? I mean, I get in, I ",156
1329,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"soap up. Some people say they steam, but when I steam, I also have to carry water out there. In the ",157
1330,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"summer I always steam more because I get rainwater. But in the winter, I don't want to steam because ",158
1331,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,"even though they say you might be using less if I take a shower, I'd use less than if I steam because I'm ",159
1332,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,gonna put water on the steam and then I got to soap up and then off. ,160
1338,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. Okay.  ",161
1333,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewee,So I feel like I've used more when I steam than as opposed to want I take a military shower.  ,162
1339,April 22,Interview 19 ,133,1,Interviewer,A quick one. Yeah. Okay. Okay. ,163
1340,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewee,"Get all wet and get all soaped off but yeah, because this way the water is pouring over you but if you're ",164
1341,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewee,"in the steam than you gotta pour it over you, so you’re using more. I bring two buckets ",165
1349,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's not as easy as coming out of the faucet. Okay. Well, I guess, is there any, anything that you ",166
1350,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewer,"like, if you could change anything about your water system, is there something you would change? ",167
1342,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewee,"Honestly, I really wish they would think about getting more into wells. But they won't, I don't think they ",168
1343,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewee,"will, just because of the septic tanks. But if they put the leach beds in it, you know, but they don't want ",169
1344,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewee,"to do that either, because then it'll do the global warming contribution to making the ground warmer, ",170
1345,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewee,"because we're already getting permafrost less and less permafrost here, so.  ",171
1351,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewer,So worried about the septic?  ,172
1346,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewee,"Yes, we do this leach bed.  ",173
1352,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewer,It'll make it warmer.  ,174
1347,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewee,So it's crazy. Yeah. You're in a big circle.  ,175
1353,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. It’s a hard problem. Yeah. Yeah. ,176
1348,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewee,"Well, so how did you get into doing this?  ",177
1354,April 22,Interview 19 ,134,1,Interviewer,"Yes, yeah. So, I am. Well, that was the last question. So I'll pause this and just ",178
1367,April 22,Interview 2 ,6,2,Interviewer,"Okay, perfect. Okay, so can you tell us a little bit about yourself? Where are you? ",1
1355,April 22,Interview 2 ,6,2,Interviewee,My name is [REDACTED]. ,2

1369,April 22,Interview 2 ,6,2,Interviewer,How about your household water can you tell us what? ,9
1361,April 22,Interview 2 ,6,2,Interviewee,"Household water. Couple years later we finally have flushing toilets, water, and sewer. ",10

1373,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,"No, long time ago. After everything we got water and sewer. ",19
1385,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewer,Do you like the piped water? ,20
1374,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, I kinda like it but sometimes it gets really dark. To get clear you have to keep it running for a ",21
1375,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,while until it gets really clear.  ,22
1386,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. ",23
1376,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,Sometimes I don’t think our [inaudible; likely “pipes”] never been washed for so many years. Get real ,24
1377,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,"contaminated water sometimes. So, I was thinking probably some people get ill from that water when ",25
1378,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,they drink it. Especially some more people never watch when they flush they get the water from the ,26
1379,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,sinks or whatever. ,27
1387,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. Do you do you have to do anything to maintain your water system in your house? Does it ,28
1388,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewer,break and you have to fix it? ,29
1380,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, I forgot 2000 something we didn’t get the water sewer not very long. I think it was in 2017, I’m not ",30

1389,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewer,That's when you got piped water?  ,32
1382,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, piped water. ",33
1390,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewer,"So, your system’s still kind of new. ",34
1383,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,Yeah. Still kind of new. [REDACTED]. But then the other ones they’re using them big tanks. And they ,35
1384,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewee,have different kind of water sewer over there. But they [inaudible] finally got water and sewer. ,36
1391,April 22,Interview 2 ,7,1,Interviewer,Do you ever it's so it's worked well since you've got it? ,37
1392,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,38
1404,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewer,"So, nothing's gone wrong? It doesn't freeze or? ",39
1393,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,It doesn’t freeze. ,40
1405,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewer,"Good. No, that's great to see. ",41
1394,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,Take and clean everything and clean my sinks out. But I also get some parts where they have ,42
1395,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,problems. ,43
1406,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewer,"No that's great, though. So let me turn the page here. It’s the wrong direction, and my fingers are cold. ",44
1407,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewer,"All right. So, you said you had run honey buckets and hauled water before you did piped water? ",45
1396,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, before we did piped water, we used to get water from the river, and it’s real clear this time of ",46
1397,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,year. It’s real clear from the rainwater. ,47
1408,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, okay. So, what do you what do you like about your water system? ",48
1398,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,It’s good. Once in a while we have problems with water pumps not working or something when the ,49
1399,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,"lights go off, especially in the cold weather in the wintertime. Couple of pipes busted there under ",50
1400,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,ground it was so cold and everything. We try to keep the house warm to keep those pipes inside the ,51
1401,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,house. I had a problem once. Couldn’t get any water for about a month. Some I think a pipe broke back ,52
1402,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,in the water pump or sewer. I lost water all over. ,53
1409,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewer,It flooded your house? ,54
1403,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. No, no. Up in the sewer where we get the water pump. ",55
1410,April 22,Interview 2 ,8,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. So, it flooded outside of your house? ",56
1411,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,Yeah. It didn’t flood out my house. ,57
1421,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay, okay. Outside of your house. ",58
1412,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,"But one thing that I have is my house is to the ground. We have high ground, but our land is too low ",59
1413,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,little bit and water comes from right there overflows in front of my house. Outside we have a tank out ,60
1414,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,there.  ,61
1422,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewer,"No that’s not good. No, that's – okay. Okay. So, do you do worry whether your water’s safe to drink or ",62
1423,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewer,you feel comfortable with the water? ,63
1415,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,I feel it’s safe now. ,64
1424,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewer,You feel it’s safe now? ,65
1416,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,It’s safe and I can taste a lot of that chlorine or whatever. It’s really strong and you can smell it when ,66
1417,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,you drink it.  ,67
1425,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, it tastes funny, doesn’t it? ",68
1418,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,But it’s better after a couple years later. Run for a while before you drink water out the sink. But it’s ,69
1419,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,good now. ,70
1426,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewer,It’s good now? ,71
1420,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewee,Yeah. Yeah. ,72
1427,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewer,"Good. Okay, so I think one of the last questions we have is if you could change something about your ",73
1428,April 22,Interview 2 ,9,1,Interviewer,water system what would you change? If you could wave a magic wand and something changed? ,74
1429,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,"Last couple years, I haven't changed anything so far. The [inaudible; likely “stool”] in my sinks water ",75
1430,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,"where I wash, my wife do the dishes or. My showers are okay, and bath is okay. I haven’t changed ",76
1431,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,those only the sink water. ,77
1450,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewer,"Okay, and so do you change the faucet? What are you changing? ",78
1432,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,My faucet in the sink. The sink valves where we shut off the water on and off. ,79
1451,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay, so you change that. ",80
1433,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,81
1452,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. Is there anything that I’m missing. Okay. Are there any other things that you think about ",82
1453,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewer,stories about water or anything else you want to share? ,83
1434,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,"This time of year, especially when the snow is melting and like springtime and like right now it’s getting ",84
1435,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,"warm out there and everything. Every year when we go down to river or some place, we see lots of ",85
1436,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,plastics and oil and everything you know flowing down. Really hurts me sometimes when I see those. I ,86
1437,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,"go out and pick ‘em, put ‘em in the trash bag, bring ‘em home. Even out in the country, when I go up I ",87
1438,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,see a lot of that. Come out from the tundra and see the flow. We have lots of flowing water from the ,88
1439,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,"lake right now. We have lots of flowing water coming from the hill from the mountains or someplace, ",89
1440,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,and you can see cans pop cans and whatever.  ,90
1441,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,"I’ll see this when I, and it really hurts when I see those things. Passing old age, we didn’t see those. ",91
1442,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,"Our family and our parents used to tell us teach us how to, you go out in the country or someplace ",92
1443,April 22,Interview 2 ,10,1,Interviewee,"there in a village. You see those, please pick them up. Don’t just leave them out there. Or some filth ",93

1614,April 22,Interview 21 ,144,1,Interviewee,their fault for not delivering it. ,41
1622,April 22,Interview 21 ,144,1,Interviewer,"And you've got drinking covered but showering and dishes and cooking. Yeah, that’s a problem. That’s ",42

1616,April 22,Interview 21 ,144,1,Interviewee,But I think too it's hard because my [REDACTED]. He doesn’t wanna work there. When you think about ,46
1617,April 22,Interview 21 ,144,1,Interviewee,"you're in and out of your truck all day. Late hours, early hours. Cold weather, hot weather. Sometimes ",47
1618,April 22,Interview 21 ,144,1,Interviewee,you have to do the sewer and then it’s stinky. ,48
1625,April 22,Interview 21 ,144,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, it's a hard job. No, it is tough. It's not easy. No, that's. That's hard. So that's okay. So apart from ",49
1626,April 22,Interview 21 ,144,1,Interviewer,"the non-delivery, do you ever have issues with pipes freezing or? ",50
1627,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,You know what we did on our sewer just this year for the first time and it was like in the beginning of ,51
1628,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,"spring, it wasn't below freezing. And we didn't know why, but they didn't pump the sewer that time. But ",52
1629,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,"the water, I think it's just been one time. My husband usually goes out and just [inaudible] until they ",53
1630,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,deliver. ,54
1638,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewer,Okay. And how's the affordability of the water?  ,55
1631,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,Awful. ,56
1639,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewer,Really high? ,57

1640,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewer,That’s a lot for water. Really hard. If you had the option to go on piped? ,59
1633,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,Absolutely. No question.  ,60
1641,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewer,And like water quality what? What benefits would it?  ,61
1634,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,"I mean, hopefully the water quality will be better, but I can't imagine it being any worse.  ",62
1642,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. Yeah.  ",63
1635,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,"Cuz it's pretty awful now, and we're paying a lot of money for it. And it'd be convenient not to have to ",64
1636,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,worry about them delivering. ,65
1643,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. So that if they expanded and you had an option you would absolutely go on it. ,66
1637,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewee,Absolutely.  ,67
1644,April 22,Interview 21 ,145,1,Interviewer,You think for the whole of [REDACTED] that’s a good move?  ,68
1645,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,I think that would be an excellent move. The city of  [REDACTED] might not like it because it’ll lose a lot ,69
1646,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,of money. ,70
1658,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, well, upfront, though, right, like long term operation and maintenance of hauled water is maybe a ",71
1659,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewer,"little higher. Yeah, that's. So if you could change one thing that's not putting yourself on piped water, ",72
1660,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewer,there's something you would change about your system maybe the filtration of the water. ,73
1647,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. Yeah, that and making sure that it's delivered consistently, and you don’t have to worry about ",74
1648,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,calling them and follow up. And the price would be nice as well. It’s so high $150 a fill. It's ridiculous. ,75
1649,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,"And then if you if they forget and don't fill you, then they want to charge you another $150 for coming ",76
1650,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,late.  ,77
1661,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that’s tough. That’s hard. ",78
1651,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,"They're, they're not easy to work with the city.  ",79
1662,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewer,How does how was shifting from [REDACTED] to here?  ,80
1652,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,"Oh yeah, but water was completely one of the biggest. Do you have enough water to flush the toilet all ",81
1653,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,"the time? I mean, we're fine with just two of us but if we have our family come over it’s an issue. ",82
1663,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Showers and that kind of thing. How'd you like that you ran out enough times? And figured it out? ,83
1654,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,"It took a couple of times, but you know, we just monitor it. Decide when we can wash our rug and what ",84
1655,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,we can't or when we can wash our sheets. When you can do extra laundry or do the basics.  ,85
1664,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewer,Each two weeks it definitely covers showers and cooking and flushing toilet and then some laundry? ,86
1656,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. And then you have to decide if you have extra towards the end of the period, you can wash your ",87
1657,April 22,Interview 21 ,146,1,Interviewee,"rug like that or your sheets and if not, you don't. ",88
1670,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay, okay. That makes sense. Have you lived in [REDACTED] for your whole time? ",89
1665,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,90
1671,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewer,"Okay, how was what else did you have to get used to living here? ",91
1666,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewee,"Probably just having to fly out not being able to just go. And then the cost, the cost of living the cost of ",92
1667,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewee,"buying milk, the cost of going to [REDACTED] because you have to fly. ",93
1672,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Where do you do most of your grocery big grocery shopping? Is it here or?  ,94
1668,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,95
1673,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That’s awesome. Yeah, I mean, is there is I think that's most like the questions I ",96
1674,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewer,had is anything that I haven't asked. I should have.  ,97
1669,April 22,Interview 21 ,147,1,Interviewee,I don't think so.  ,98
1683,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewer,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
1684,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewer,"Well, we're here asking people about water. And we study water. So are you on the hauled or piped ",2
1685,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewer,system here?  ,3
1675,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewee,Hauled. ,4
1686,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewer,"Hauled. Okay, and how often do you get it delivered? ",5
1676,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewee,Umm. We actually only get it once a month. And it's 1000 gallons. Two of us now. My husband and me. ,6
1677,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewee,"We used to have two kids/’]\ at home. But we do, when my one son visits we have a sauna for first that ",7
1678,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewee,and in the summer we will we get rainwater. ,8
1687,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewer,"Nice, nice. And collection from your roof? ",9
1679,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewee,Yes. And then what really – we probably just use half a tank now because of the [REDACTED].  ,10
1688,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewer,Oh yeah.  ,11
1680,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewee,"And shower there. But we’ve always been able you know when the kids were young, we would put the ",12
1681,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewee,cleanest person in the shower first. And collect water for the bathtub for the youngest who got dirtiest. ,13
1689,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewer,I love that. How did you assess who was the cleanest? Visually? ,14
1682,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewee,"Me. The boys, the two young ones. But we've always made it work. One way or another. ",15
1690,April 22,Interview 22 ,148,2,Interviewer,So have you ever run out of water? ,16
1691,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,Yes. Not too often. We've actually learned to haul a couple times up at the pump station. But the ,17
1692,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,rainwater. I just you know we never run water in the sink ever. If you gotta run it for the shower to get ,18
1693,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,"hot, we collect it. We still do that. And then that water in a bucket, and then that water goes for the ",19
1694,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,sauna. Or for plants. And or even the toilet. We don't we don't waste. Even now that we have more with ,20
1695,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,two of us. ,21
1704,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewer,Just have it now though. Protection of the resource. ,22
1696,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,"And when I travel, you know I can't take the long showers.  ",23
1705,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewer,"Yes. Yes. Yeah. So, when you run out you do call it from the water the treatment if you need to. It's ",24
1706,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewer,probably been a long time since you’ve run out. ,25
1697,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,it's been a long time since we've run out and before we before we knew about that we would maybe we ,26
1698,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,used to keep five gallons just in case and then maybe I'd go get five gallons. ,27
1707,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. ",28
1699,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,Yeah. Boys just learn. ,29
1708,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. I mean, what a great lesson for kids right is that's a resource to protect. Did you ever have ",30
1709,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewer,in the delivery and kind of taking away of sewage as to would you ever have any issues in that ,31
1710,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewer,process? Frozen pipes or service? ,32
1700,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. And then one time they didn't they didn't pick up or evacuate, and a few days later you smelled ",33
1701,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,sewage.  ,34
1711,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewer,Yeah. ,35
1702,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,"It's pretty pretty good. But my husband, I mean if it was just me, I would have had a lot of problems. ",36
1703,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewee,He’s a [inaudible] so he stays on top of it. ,37
1712,April 22,Interview 22 ,149,1,Interviewer,Oh cool. Do you have any cool like what's his best solution so far? If any come to mind? ,38
1713,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,"No, but he has we have rain barrels everywhere he was a [REDACTED] so we have tanks, big tanks. ",39
1714,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,"So when it rains, we collect cuz we have a greenhouse. And then we also live by ",40
1715,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,Hoffman lake ,41
1716,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED],42
1717,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee, so we always have we have a small boat that we put on the tundra with a pump. So he ,43
1718,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,"does in the summer, he's definitely pulls water for our because of our garden. ",44
1726,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, what are you what are you growing? ",45
1719,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,The [inaudible] crops. Peas and carrots and squash. Potatoes.  ,46
1727,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewer,Oh cool. How does it taste? Does it taste fine? Does it taste normal? ,47
1720,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,From the city? ,48
1728,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewer,Yes.  ,49
1721,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,I cannot drink it. ,50
1729,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewer,You can't? You don't drink it? ,51
1722,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,"I do because we have a filter that it goes through in the house and then I use Brita. But he, everybody ",52
1723,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,else in my family will drink it without using a Brita.  ,53
1730,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. What is it? What don't you like about the taste?  ,54
1724,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,I just don't like it; it doesn't taste good. There’s some flavor there. ,55
1731,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Minerally or chemically? Or? ,56
1725,April 22,Interview 22 ,150,1,Interviewee,Or dirt or you know just something.  ,57
1746,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. But if you run it through a Brita first. ,58
1732,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,"And then if the filter has gotten, it needs to be changed. In the house. I will, I find that I will do the Brita ",59
1733,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,twice. ,60
1747,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. That's what are your thoughts on piped water? ",61
1748,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewer,What it - how does that compare? ,62
1734,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,I have friends that love it now that they can shower as much as they want. They don’t worry about the ,63
1735,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,"water. But when I look at housing and I see some of that water, it looks brown. And I don't know.  ",64
1749,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. If you had the option to switch, would you stay on hauled or switch to piped? ",65
1736,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,"As long as I have my husband, I would stay on hauled. But gosh I just don’t know. We have four small ",66
1737,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,rentals in the [REDACTED]. And they are gonna go to piped. And we are gonna get to save money. ,67
1750,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewer,Test trial.  ,68
1738,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,"So my husband is very, very nervous about how you make that switch. And people still have water. And ",69
1739,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,"then if it freezes, I mean, there's a lot more issues. Yeah. And we already have totally worked out to ",70
1740,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,"hauled. Not totally. I mean, there are times when we have to get the hair dryer. Well, actually. Yes. Our ",71
1741,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,pipe freezes a lot. We have a hairdryer hooked to it. ,72
1751,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. Yeah. In like your Arctic entry? Or where does it freeze? ,73
1742,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,"Outside the house. The pipes that get in the exposed part, and so we’ll have to turn. You know, we ",74
1743,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,"don't have to do it for long. And then he has, what we have in the house now, we have – I realize now ",75
1744,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,"he has a drip system. Mechanical. And if we don't turn it up a level, but it’s really getting old. And ",76
1745,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewee,maybe a little [inaudible]. But we've been there for [REDACTED] years in this house. ,77
1752,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewer,And so the drip system just kind of keep the water slowly moving through so it doesn't freeze. And if it ,78
1753,April 22,Interview 22 ,151,1,Interviewer,"freezes, then you turn the hairdryer on and just heat up that little section, and it’s all good. ",79
1754,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,80
1765,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay. If your section freezes, does it impact that one, what I wanna figure out is, does it does it ",81
1766,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewer,spread throughout the pipes or does it freeze in one section? ,82
1755,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,"It would if we weren’t on top of it. Every day, I mean, every time we either one of us during the night will ",83
1756,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,"hear the pump running and come and turn it off. We’re on it. Now if we were traveling, we don't have a ",84
1757,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,"ring or whatever that system is to tell you if it’s frozen. We generally, we have a house [inaudible]. I ",85
1758,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,"don’t know, but my husband still could, he’s under the house cleaning. Our tank is buried under the ",86
1759,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,house. ,87
1767,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Do you ever have to when it when it melts, do you have concerns about it floating? ",88
1760,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,"No, we’re actually in a place that we could have had a root cellar or basement even covered after we ",89
1761,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,processed the building to a house. So not like most people here.  ,90
1768,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewer,"Okay, that makes sense. Okay. Okay. Let's see. I think that that covers most of our questions. Is there ",91
1769,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewer,"anything you would change? I mean, about the system as it is or?  ",92
1762,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,I don't think so.  ,93
1770,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. No, you’re happy with it. I love that though. ",94
1763,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,It’s not so much happy. It is what it is. We just live a subsistence lifestyle.  ,95
1771,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. No, that's awesome. Is there anything else that I should have asked you that I didn't? ",96
1764,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewee,And I did start with a honey bucket here so. ,97
1772,April 22,Interview 22 ,152,1,Interviewer,Okay. Yeah. Yes.  ,98
1773,April 22,Interview 22 ,153,1,Interviewee,You know this is not a honey bucket any more so.  ,99
1778,April 22,Interview 22 ,153,1,Interviewer,Do you like the? So the honey bucket to this was a good good change? ,100
1774,April 22,Interview 22 ,153,1,Interviewee,The honey bucket system works because your outhouse in your house. But I would love it when we ,101
1775,April 22,Interview 22 ,153,1,Interviewee,didn’t have to deal with frozen honey bucket and melting and all that and the smell. My sister came to ,102
1776,April 22,Interview 22 ,153,1,Interviewee,"visit once in the early years. I thought I prepared her and I hear this, ‘Oh my god’ when she went into ",103
1777,April 22,Interview 22 ,153,1,Interviewee,the little bathroom.  ,104
1779,April 22,Interview 22 ,153,1,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's just getting used to it. Right? ",105
1803,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewer,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
1780,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"I have always had delivered water. We had [inaudible; likely “dip”] water for a long time, and then honey ",2
1781,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"buckets. But then we, thank God but we have we're not on the piped water. ",3
1804,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewer,"Okay, so you have hauled water now. Okay. Okay. And what do you what do you like about what you ",4
1805,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewer,have now versus before? How does it feel different from your own experience? ,5
1782,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"What I like is, we can control. You know, if, if, if something goes wrong, we can fix it. We don't have to ",6
1783,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,wait for the city to come and all that stuff. We hardly ever have anything go wrong. But because we're ,7
1784,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"on hauled water, we're very conservative. We could bump it up and get more water. But we don't really ",8
1785,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"need to, and we're just careful with it. And I have been appalled that the city put in piped water, and it's ",9
1786,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"even more people on piped water and there's no metering, none whatsoever. They have meters, but ",10
1787,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"they don't read them. So those folks have unlimited water. Unlimited, for a flat rate. We pay twice as ",11
1788,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"much as they do, and we have our limit. And I'm not resentful of cost differential. I'm resentful that the ",12
1789,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"city is being so careless. Because we have a sewer lagoon that is has a finite capacity, and we're ",13
1790,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"almost at that capacity. I mean, surely, the estimates are like [REDACTED] million. They don't even ",14
1791,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"have a site yet. Yeah. Okay. What are we going to do, folks? Those things concern me. Not to mention ",15
1792,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,the ugly pipes that go through people's yards. Nobody else would put up with that. ,16
1806,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewer,"So, if it were up to you, and this the whole city could, hauled would probably be ideal or? ",17
1793,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"Well, you know, all the environmental people are my friends. They're really just like adamant, it has to ",18
1794,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,be piped. They see. They feel like it's not safe. It's not clean. Or the too many opportunities for it to get ,19
1795,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"contaminated, I guess. But I don't know if many, you know, situations like that. And certainly we've ",20
1796,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,never had it. So I think it's important to be careful what you wish the city put in piped water in city ,21
1797,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"subdivision about 10 years ago. And we had property there, which they just criss-crossed with their ugly ",22
1798,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"pipe. We didn't have a choice whether or not to do it. Of course, we had to do it. And we've had to call ",23
1799,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"the city here over the years, probably four times, because some part of their system broke down. ",24
1800,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,"Leaking sewage, leaking water, and then they had to come and fix it. Well that doesn't happen with our ",25
1801,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,systems at home. And I was gonna say something else about that. I don't remember what else I was ,26
1802,April 22,Interview 23 ,154,2,Interviewee,gonna say about it. But I have pretty strong opinions about it.  ,27
1817,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. And so your system on hold. So that works well for you. So you're getting it delivered when ",28
1818,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,you need it. It's getting the sewers getting picked up when you need it. ,29
1807,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative). ,30
1819,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,What do you do anything in your home once it is delivered? Do you do anything with that water? Does it ,31
1820,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,run the way you want it to? ,32
1808,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewee,"Right. Well, we have our own filtration. We have two filters on it. ",33
1821,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,"Okay, that's helpful to know.  ",34
1809,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewee,"And you know, my husband just changes them out every once in a while, so there's not much to it. ",35
1822,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,"Right, right. Yeah. Do you ever have any, if something does break inside your home you guys are able ",36
1823,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,to fix it or do you get help from others to do that? ,37

1811,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewee,"a such a simple system, that most people can figure out their own system and keep track of that. It's ",39
1812,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewee,kind of like you have to learn what it is. And what are the what's that noise? Why is the pump running? ,40
1813,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewee,"Nobody's using water are they? So then you go figure it out. And it's simple. It’s a simple system, but on ",41
1814,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewee,"the city's system, you don’t have any control over it. ",42
1824,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. ",43
1815,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewee,And it’s ugly. And the city is it cost the city a lot more than they thought it was going to because they ,44
1816,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewee,have had to maintain it at a level when they didn't dream they were going to have to do that.  ,45
1825,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,Sure. [REDACTED] ,46
1826,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,"That's amazing. So, was your transition with kind of figuring out you said you were on dip water when ",47
1827,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,"you got here. Well, how was that transition? Kind of figuring that out coming from I assume in ",48
1828,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,Kansas ,49
1829,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer,City [REDACTED],50
1830,April 22,Interview 23 ,155,1,Interviewer, you had piped water? ,51
1831,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"Unbelievable. We had 30 gallon trash cans in our kitchen, and they would come in once a week with a ",52
1832,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"hose and fill it up. We had two, cuz there was a number of us living in this little freezing little house. And ",53
1833,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"yeah, and you just dipped out with a pitcher. And then we just go back and look at that, and go, ‘wow ",54
1834,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"did we really do that.’ And we had a honey bucket, a five gallon bucket with a seat in a little closet in our ",55
1835,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"house. And when that bucket got full or as full as you wanted to carry it, and you pick it up and carry it ",56
1836,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"outside, set it by the driveway. Seriously, that was gross. And then in the wintertime, you can’t put it out ",57
1837,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,cuz it would freeze. So you had to find someplace.  ,58
1853,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewer,Okay. Just figure out how to make it worse. ,59
1838,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"So what people use for the smell was pine-sol. And to this day, anybody around here that was here ",60
1839,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"with dip water and honey buckets will just go. The first people that ran our school, they were using pine-",61
1840,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"sol, and we just went in with ‘Oh, my God, no. They don't know. We can’t have pine-sol.’ And the ",62
1841,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"[inaudible; likely “children”] were like, ‘what.’ And everybody’s coming and going like, ‘why does that ",63
1842,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,smell like honey buckets?’  ,64
1854,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewer,"Wow, yeah, that's a good thing to know. ",65
1843,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"It's really a terrible smell. Right, so the city would come by once a week with their truck, and guys would ",66
1844,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"dump the buckets. It was, it was bizarre.   ",67
1855,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewer,Sure. Sure. Do you have any? How's your experience with the different seasons here with the hauled ,68
1856,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewer,"system that you have now? Do you, do you make changes in the winter versus the summer and how ",69
1857,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewer,does that work for you? ,70
1845,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"Well, our water tank is outside. It’s foamed and insulated. But nevertheless, when it's really cold the ",71
1846,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,water’s just sitting there. Especially with just my husband and I now we don't use it as much as when ,72
1847,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"the kids were home. It was constantly being sucked in. With just two of us, it’s less so, so it's more ",73
1848,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,likely to freeze up. So we have a tank here that the local welder makes. And if we're going to be gone in ,74
1849,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"the wintertime, we just put a timer on it. So every day the tank heater comes on for two hours and off to ",75
1850,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,"just keep the water from freezing. If we're home, you know if it gets really really cold we might turn it on ",76
1851,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,every once in a while just to make sure. So we have to do that kind of thing but the sewer never ,77
1852,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewee,freezes. It's underground. So it's pretty it's pretty simple. It's just the water. ,78
1858,April 22,Interview 23 ,156,1,Interviewer,Is it common for the sewer tanks to be underground? I don't know that I've seen that around here. ,79
1859,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,Some of ‘em are. ,80
1871,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewer,Depends on when it was put in and where you're at? ,81
1860,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,82
1861,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,He always stays busy. A lot of them and the sewer tanks are mostly made out of steel. So eventually ,83
1862,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,"they rust out. Lots of people's water tanks used to be made of steel. Those were a mess. Just, you ",84
1863,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,"know just rust and it was gross. And they would pop leak, and it would get thin spots and start to leak. ",85
1864,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,"So a lot of what he does is he's replacing the steel ones with the foam ones, I mean plastic ones, or, or ",86
1865,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,"just new new tanks for people. Most of the people don’t put them underground, I think. ",87
1872,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewer,I'm going to check my list super quick and make sure I didn't miss any questions that I need to make ,88
1873,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewer,sure. But I think we've covered most of what I want to ask you. But I guess my last one is just if you ,89
1874,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewer,"could change anything about the system, whether it's your personal system or the system as a whole, if ",90
1875,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewer,"you could wave a magic wand, what would you do for [REDACTED]? ",91
1866,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,"I would somehow make it more affordable. Yeah, it's a lot of money. ",92
1876,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's a big concern. ",93
1867,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,"I mean, I don't know what the piped people pay the flat rate. I don't think they paid for it nearly what we ",94
1868,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,pay. ,95
1877,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewer,Right. The hauled is more expensive.  ,96
1869,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,I think ours is like our water and sewer is $180 a month? ,97
1878,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, it's a lot for two people. Yeah. And how often do you get serviced?  ",98
1870,April 22,Interview 23 ,157,1,Interviewee,We get it every two weeks. ,99
1888,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewer,Every two weeks.  ,100
1879,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewee,"After our kids left home, we went, ‘okay freedom.’ It’s every two weeks, and we still have plenty.  ",101
1889,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewer,"That's great. Okay. Well, so lastly, is there anything you want to tell me that I didn't ask you or any ",102
1890,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewer,questions that you have for me anything else that you want to talk about it? ,103
1880,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewee,"No. The state has promised for years to bring clean water to every community, and they have never ",104
1881,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewee,gotten that done. So it's that's that's sad. It's not right. I'm not sure that putting in piped water and sewer ,105
1882,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewee,"in the villages is the right thing because if we have trouble here, oh my gosh. They don't have ",106
1883,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewee,"engineers sitting around and contractors sitting around ready to fix things. So, the more complex ",107
1884,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewee,"system they put in, and there are villages who have already given up on the pipe water. We can't keep ",108
1885,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewee,that going. Thank you very much federal government but they just can't keep it they can't afford it. So ,109
1886,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewee,they've gone back to dip water or hauling water to their houses. I wish everybody can have clean water ,110
1887,April 22,Interview 23 ,158,1,Interviewee,though. It's United States of America for crying out loud. ,111
1902,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewer,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
1903,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewer,"Yeah. Well, so your piped? ",2
1891,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,Yes ,3
1904,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewer,Okay awesome. And how do you like that? ,4
1892,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,"It works well. It's nice to have unlimited water. It’s still really dirty. Our house is a triple, triple filtered, ",5
1893,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,and then we also filter our water with like a Brita and because if you don't use the Brita you still get like ,6
1894,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,sediment. Which is amazing that it comes through in triple filters and there’s still sediment. ,7
1905,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewer,"That's a lot. Yeah, yeah.  ",8
1895,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,But the water tastes really good.  ,9
1906,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewer,"Oh, that's good. Okay, cool. And so so when you're drinking your water, it's got that three filters on the ",10
1907,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewer,"Britta, and then what else do you use your water for at home? ",11
1896,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,"Coffee, so we use filtered water for coffee. Cooking, never use filtered. Well, I guess we use the Triple ",12
1897,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,"Filtered for everything, even the showering, but we don’t Brita anything except our drinking water. ",13
1898,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,Sometimes to drink coffee water. Sometimes we don't. We use it for boiling and freezing. Showering. ,14
1899,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,Washing the car. We’re one of the weird people that washes our car because we’re so used to it. ,15
1908,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Nice. Um, so do you ever have any challenges to that water? Do you any especially ",16
1909,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewer,"any, like seasonally do things change throughout the year that you have to work with? ",17
1900,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,"Um, I guess the pipes freeze. That’s an issue that happened once over the winter when we got to like ",18
1901,April 22,Interview 24 ,159,2,Interviewee,negative 30. ,19
1926,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewer,Very different from [REDACTED]. ,20
1910,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. Very different. So it froze, but we didn’t go without water for very long. There's some people that ",21
1911,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,there pipes would freeze and they don’t have water for a couple of days. That hasn’t been our ,22
1912,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,experience. ,23
1927,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewer,That's good. And what do you like about your water?  ,24
1913,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,"I like that it's unlimited, and that it’s piped. So, we don't have to pay to change how much we use. I ",25
1914,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,mean we're still mindful but not as much so.  ,26
1928,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewer,Wonderful. I'm gonna check my list to make sure I kind of cover some of the things that I need to cover. ,27
1929,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewer,So you like the taste of your water? ,28
1915,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,Yeah. It tastes really good. Some people don’t. It does not bother me. I guess the look is not my ,29
1916,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,"favorite, when it’s just triple filtered and not Brita filtered on top of that, because it looks real sediment ",30
1917,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,and fuzzy.  ,31
1930,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewer,"That makes that makes sense. Um, do you have to do anything inside your home? Other than I guess ",32
1931,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewer,"other than that, filter, but anything to maintain your system inside your home once again? ",33
1918,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,Don’t know exactly because we're renting. So I know that they’ve changed the filters maybe once a ,34
1919,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,"month since we’ve moved in we’ve changed it more frequently. So that's kind of, I know it's [inaudible] ",35
1920,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,"for them to like keep changing the filters. For us, we’ve changed our Brita filter at least once a month. ",36
1921,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,Which I feel like is a lot. We didn't use it to do it back home. ,37
1932,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's another thing. I was going to ask you kind of just your experiences coming from ",38
1933,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] and how does that feel different? Just some of the -  ,39
1922,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,I don’t trust the water here as much. Yeah. I trusted it more back there. I thought it was more regulated. ,40
1923,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,I don’t know if that’s true. It’s just a feeling that I have. Yeah. I don’t know if it's fluorinated. I don't think ,41
1924,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,"it is fluorinated here, and it was back home. And I wish it was here. Because I appreciate that for the ",42
1925,April 22,Interview 24 ,160,1,Interviewee,kids. They need plenty of fluoride.  ,43
1943,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewer,"Sure. All right, um, if you could change one thing about the water system here, what would you ",44
1944,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewer,change?  ,45
1934,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewee,Maybe less sediment so I don’t have to filter it so much. Very nice if they could filter out all the sand so ,46
1935,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewee,"we don’t have to do it personally. But I can't really complain, because we have city water, and not very ",47
1936,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewee,many people do. ,48
1945,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. So you have no interest in hauled water? ,49
1937,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewee,No and only because we don't have to pay attention. ,50
1946,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewer,Yeah. You don't have to think about it much.  ,51
1938,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewee,Yeah. Yes.  ,52
1947,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewer,"And so you have unlimited water, right? Because you're not metered? ",53
1939,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewee,Yes. ,54
1948,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewer,"Is it affordable, what you do have to pay? ",55
1940,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewee,"Yes. I don't know exactly because it’s mixed in our rent, but I wanna say it’s $200 a month for unlimited ",56
1941,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewee,water. Which I feel like [REDACTED].  ,57
1949,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewer,Sure. And for your whole family? ,58
1942,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,59
1950,April 22,Interview 24 ,161,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's awesome. So that covers most of the questions that I have.  ",60

1951,April 22,Interview 25,162,2,Interviewee,We’re on hauled. Same water is piped or hauled. They come and they deliver the water and they take ,2

2078,April 22,Interview 25,170,1,Interviewee,Just getting it every- ,128

2087,April 22,Interview 25,170,1,Interviewer 1,Okay.  ,131
2080,April 22,Interview 25,170,1,Interviewee,But there's a whole infrastructure built around delivering it. and there's a infrastructure around people ,132
2081,April 22,Interview 25,170,1,Interviewee,that don't get water delivered but delivered themselves. ,133
2088,April 22,Interview 25,170,1,Interviewer 1,Yes.  ,134
2082,April 22,Interview 25,170,1,Interviewee,There's little water vending places.  ,135

2085,April 22,Interview 25,170,1,Interviewee,That’s a whole other thing. ,141
2092,April 22,Interview 25,170,1,Interviewer 1,What’s your thought there? ,142
2093,April 22,Interview 25,171,1,Interviewee,Most of the villages have a school which has a water plant yet.  ,143
2095,April 22,Interview 25,171,1,Interviewer 1,Yeah ,144
2094,April 22,Interview 25,171,1,Interviewee,So the school provides more more infrastructure than just school. pretty interesting  ,145
2096,April 22,Interview 25,171,1,Interviewer 1,That is interesting. ,146
2109,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewer,Okay. I definitely wanna ask you more about that. We'll start with some water stuff. But I would love to ,1
2110,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewer,"hear some more. So for now, how do you get your water? What do you do with your water? ",2
2097,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,"So my water comes from the municipal treatment plant that dispenses it you know, in the truck, picks it ",3
2098,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,"up, delivers it to my house, I have a 500 or 800 gallon water tank attached to my house. ",4
2111,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewer,How does that work for you? ,5
2099,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,"It's okay the water is not very clear. It has a filter in the utility room where the thing is, and actually I ",6
2100,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,"went to change that after a year, after two years of living there and saw there was no filter in there. ",7
2101,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,"Right. And then we’d also been filtering it with our refrigerator filter. Which seems to filter out most of, I ",8
2102,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,think we bought one that filters out benzene. Gotta change it more often. And then we have a like one ,9
2103,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,next to the sink and you pour water into the top and flows very slowly and so water comes out the ,10
2104,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,bottom. And then that has to be changed pretty frequently also.  ,11
2112,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewer,Do you like that system?  ,12
2105,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,I like it when - I like my water to be clear. That's the only way it's gonna be [inaudible]. ,13
2113,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, so once it goes through all the things that you haven't gone through, it tastes okay? It smells ",14
2114,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewer,okay for you? ,15
2106,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,"Yeah, it's fine. If it doesn't, I mean, it'll develop quite a film on anything. The tub, the toilet, the ",16
2107,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,[inaudible] of our toilets. ,17
2115,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewer,"Okay, how’s that? ",18
2108,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewee,"Wouldn't flush. Very strong because a little tiny holes that spray the water to the bowl. Just, were not- ",19
2116,April 22,Interview 26,172,2,Interviewer,Clogged up. ,20
2127,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee ,Clogged up. ,21
2128,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewer,"Okay. So everything is filtered that you're washing with, that you're cleaning dishes with, and that you're ",22
2129,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewer,drinking? ,23
2117,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. So there's a filter I put in the utility room that would account for the shower, and the dishes and ",24
2118,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,stuff like that. I don't know how good that is. But it's the standard filter. It still puts a film on stuff. So it's ,25
2119,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,not amazing. ,26
2130,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewer,And then there's the additional for when you’re drinking it. ,27
2120,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,"Then we do additional, yeah. ",28
2131,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewer,Okay. How often do you get it delivered? ,29
2121,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,Right now we do every two weeks I think ,30
2132,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewer,"Every two weeks and you said it's a 500, 800? ",31
2122,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,"I think it's five hundred. Five hundred, yeah. ",32
2133,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewer,Do you ever run out? ,33
2123,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,Only when we had to replace the toilet. When we flushed it. With the repair people flushed it like 1000 ,34
2124,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,"times and used up too much water. But other than that, no. We could do it every week. Most people do ",35
2125,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,it every week I think ,36
2134,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewer,"When things do break, so for instance, your toilet or anything else with your water system when things ",37
2135,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewer,"break, who can you call? ",38
2126,April 22,Interview 26,173,1,Interviewee,"So I’m a renter, I call my landlord. ",39
2148,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewer,"Okay, great. And they take care of it.  ",40
2136,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,41
2149,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewer,Do you have any desire for piped water? Do you think that would be easier for ,42
2137,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewee,For what? ,43
2150,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewer,For piped water? Instead of them delivering it to you if it came just straight from the plant? ,44
2146,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I would be fine with that. Especially since it'd be the same water I think. I don’t think it would be ",45
2147,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewee ,cleaner or any more dirty. So there's no advantage to the current system. It's just it's like a stress. ,46
2151,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah.  ,47
2138,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewee,You worry about running out of water. ,48

2139,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, that time that they used up all our water and you couldn’t get more water delivered and then our ",50

2141,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewee,"delivered, right? was frozen a couple of times in a row so then they couldn’t deliver water. So that was ",52
2142,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewee,actually like the most one of the most unpleasant two weeks of my two years here. That was probably ,53
2143,April 22,Interview 26,174,1,Interviewee,"the only time we you know, bickered about utilities. Right. [inaudible] during that whole, you couldn’t ",54

2155,April 22,Interview 26,175,1,Interviewee,It’s our most expensive utility.  ,61
2163,April 22,Interview 26,175,1,Interviewer,Okay.  ,62
2156,April 22,Interview 26,175,1,Interviewee,"I think when we were doing, I think we do it two weeks, two times a week now, when it was more ",63
2157,April 22,Interview 26,175,1,Interviewee,frequent. I think it was $400 a month.  ,64
2164,April 22,Interview 26,175,1,Interviewer,"Mm, that’s a lot of money. ",65
2158,April 22,Interview 26,175,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,66

2168,April 22,Interview 26,175,1,Interviewer,So can you tell me about your experiences with water when you were in the villages? ,72
2169,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"So in the villages [REDACTED], water is almost always delivered. There's a tank the clinic has ",73
2170,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"sometimes two tanks, one for the front of the house, which one's the [REDACTED], and one for the ",74
2171,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"back, which sometimes has living quarters for the [REDACTED]. And about 30% of the time 20 to 30% ",75
2172,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"of time, showers were not an option, either, not for the whole trip or not for part of the trip. And ",76
2173,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"frequently, it would break at least for some period of time. [REDACTED], where you could not wash ",77
2174,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"your hands in the bathroom, you had to like, go to the jug they had, ladle it out of a, you know, 500 ",78
2175,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"gallon drum and take it somewhere to wash your hands. You know, when you use other methods to ",79
2176,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"wash your hands? Frequently it was, especially in the winter, it would not work. ",80
2183,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewer,So a lot more challenging than in [inaudible] ,81
2177,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,[inaudible] And then the majority of my patients in the villages do not have running water. [REDACTED] ,82
2184,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewer,"Gotcha, okay, that’s helpful. So if you could change one thing, whether it's about your water system or ",83
2185,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewer,"the villages’, what would you change? ",84
2178,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,I would make it so more people had a water delivery system that allowed you to bathe.  ,85
2186,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewer,Yeah. ,86
2179,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,Adequate water to bathe. ,87
2187,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewer,It feels so basic but ,88
2180,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, that's really huge for health. ",89
2188,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewer,Yeah.  ,90
2181,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. So the bathing system, here customarily is the [inaudible; likely “steam row”]. And that is not ",91
2182,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewee,"does not prevent infection in my experience, like regular showers. ",92
2189,April 22,Interview 26,176,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay, let me check my list and make sure I didn't forget anything. ",93
2200,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewer,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
2201,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewer,And so how do you get your water at home?  ,2
2190,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,We’re delivery. ,3
2202,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewer,Delivery? Okay. All right. And do you like that? ,4
2191,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,"It's okay, I mean, you know, you get used to it, you live here, you get used to it. When I was first here. I ",5
2192,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,had a honey bucket  ,6
2203,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewer,Okay.  ,7
2193,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,Which was quite the experience  ,8
2204,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewer,Yeah  ,9
2194,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,10
2205,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewer,Sure ,11
2195,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,But I still explained too that we're still on piped water I mean running well you got to come and get our ,12
2196,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,"water delivery and all that, they still like, “It’s 2022.” ",13
2206,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewer,Yeah ,14
2197,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,[inaudible] but this is what we’re doing. but um you know for the most part we've we really haven't had ,15
2198,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,any [inaudible] every now and then our sewer tank will freeze up. And we've had troubles with that we ,16
2199,April 22,Interview 27 ,177,3,Interviewee,"don't have them come back the next day [inaudible] but you know other than that it's been okay, we've ",17
2207,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,"got some pretty elaborate filter systems on our water system at the house there, so the water that ",18
2208,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,comes out of the sink is like on its third filter by the time it gets to the kitchen sink so ,19
2228,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewer,"Cool. So I’m gonna ask about both of those things a little bit. So the sewer, so when it does freeze up, ",20
2229,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewer,What do you need to do? Are you able to kind of take care of it? Do you need someone to come help ,21
2230,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewer,you with it?  ,22
2209,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,"No, we pretty much take care of it ourselves. We now have up to [inaudible] a system for it. We plug ",23
2210,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,that in usually a day or two before our system is time for us to get evacuated. So it's pretty thawed out ,24
2211,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,by. And then a couple of times we've kind of gone over paid attention to it and or it had gotten you back ,25
2212,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,"in completely the first time and that's kind of messy. But you know we see that right away like stop, no ",26
2213,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,more running water and you know the city has that [REDACTED] that you know your super tank. I think ,27
2214,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,"it's like either 200 or 500 gallons bigger than water tank which is a good idea. Yeah, I think at first I ",28
2215,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,don't think we did because I remember we had to redo our feedback tank because it wasn't quite big ,29
2216,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,"enough and we've gotten a bigger water tank in the meantime because family grew and so yeah, but ",30
2217,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,it's not easy kind of thawing out your sewer tank you know when you don't have a heat system on it but ,31
2218,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,now it's a lot easier so. ,32
2231,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewer,Now you flip the switch as long as you remember to do it the day or two before ,33
2219,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,"Yep, yep that’s usually what we do. Especially you know the temps are way below zero so yeah a ",34
2220,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,couple of weeks because we're once a month now since we’re only my husband and I just have three ,35
2221,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,"dogs, we are kind of empty nesters and nobody else, but yeah. ",36
2232,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewer,"Okay, and from the city side when they come to you know either evacuate or drop off water how does ",37
2233,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewer,that work? Do you ever have any challenges with that especially in different weather? ,38
2222,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,"Yes, they ran right into our garage, put a big dent in the garage, and kind of tore the wall down a little ",39
2223,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,bit the city was okay with it. And then one other time I was at school and my husband calls me and ,40
2224,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,"goes you need to come home right now. I’m like, what happened? One of the guys had I guess hit the ",41
2225,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,reverse thing and sewer came up through the toilets and all our water faucets and [REDACTED]. So ,42
2226,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,they kinda compensated us a little bit to help with that because I took the rest day off to clean ,43
2227,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewee,everything up. It was pretty gross. So Yeah. That does happen. ,44
2234,April 22,Interview 27 ,178,1,Interviewer,"Right. Yeah, okay, okay. ",45
2235,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,I mean so now when it's water day I kind of put the plugs on the tanks and put the toilet seats down but ,46
2236,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,it probably would still blow your seat off if they reversed and  ,47
2252,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, those are powerful hoses  ",48
2237,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,"I think it’s probably a little bit safer if it happens again. Good. Yeah, we've had some experiences. But ",49
2238,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,it’s home. ,50
2253,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewer,"And so your water filters that you have so, so the water gets delivered into your tank and then it goes ",51
2254,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewer,through these filters. And that's the what you're using for drinking for- ,52
2239,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,For bathing and all that. We have a filter system right there like that. Because we have our water tank ,53
2240,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,outside. Because we have a bigger one. And comes in through the outside goes down around that ,54
2241,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,water heater and around the water tank there. We have a filter system right there and then also at the ,55
2242,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,kitchen sink. We have a filter system and then also on the refrigerator. A water one. [inaudible] ,56
2255,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewer,Cool so the water you’re drinking is a little bit extra ,57
2243,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,"[inaudible] Yeah, we could ask them to please eat or drink from the refrigerator or from the sink, and for ",58
2244,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,"bathroom water, it's okay, but not the greatest. ",59
2256,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewer,"And how do you like that? Taste wise, smell wise? Aesthetics? ",60
2245,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,"You know, everybody says, first come in I kind of warn people, I say, I don't know if it's true or not. You ",61
2246,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,"know, you get that [REDACTED] pride first couple times of drinking the water and all. I don't know. I ",62
2247,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,"don't notice anything. Maybe I've been here too long. You know, I don't know. My husband drinks really ",63
2248,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,"filtered, well he gets the water from [REDACTED] guys. I'm accustomed to it. I make my juice out of it. I ",64
2249,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,make my iced tea. So I'm okay.  ,65
2257,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, your body adapts over time. ",66
2250,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] So sometimes I am careful though, when, depending on where, where some of the water ",67
2251,April 22,Interview 27 ,179,1,Interviewee,was coming from. ,68
2272,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewer,"Sure. When, when you're going places in town or in the area? ",69
2258,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED].  ,70
2273,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah ,71
2259,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,You’ve got a point. Our waters good! ,72
2274,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Have you ever been on piped water in [REDACTED]? Have you always had that hauled?  ,73
2260,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,Always had it. ,74
2275,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewer,Always. Except for what the very beginning when you had a honey bucket. ,75
2261,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, yeah. That was interesting. ",76
2276,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewer,Yeah. If you could change anything about your system would you? ,77
2262,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,"I wouldn't mind having the piped. I think it would probably be a lot better. But yeah, I don't know if they ",78
2263,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,could ever do that with everybody here in [REDACTED]…right up by the sewer lagoon. Sometimes on ,79
2264,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,"you know, the south wind would blow we had to close the windows because it got a little, you know you ",80
2265,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,didn’t want to have the windows opened during then and got pretty hot there sometimes. We didn't ,81
2266,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,"have air conditioning either. Okay, sometimes I said yes. Used to smell like opening my windows. Yes. ",82
2267,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,So.  ,83
2277,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewer,Yeah.  ,84
2268,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,"And just yeah. And you know for the most part, all our delivery guys have been just honest. I can’t ",85
2269,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,"complain about, except the one that kind of ran into the garage, you know, an old tank like that. I mean, ",86
2270,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,"you know, I’d probably keep running into all everything. You know, we have we put cones out now. You ",87
2271,April 22,Interview 27 ,180,1,Interviewee,"know, so they can see where the porch? I don't know, how they do it with it being so dark and all that ",88
2278,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewee,"and I'm just like, You guys are darn good drivers, because I could never back that thing up into our ",89

2289,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, we've kind of watched a few of them here actually, in the place we're staying. They were ",91
2290,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewer,delivering water yesterday. We were sitting out on the front porch watching them. ,92
2280,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewee,"Oh yeah, you have to! It’s quite an experience for people that don’t understand it. ",93
2291,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewer,"It was really, it was nice, absolutely. And these drivers are impressive.  ",94
2281,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, in the hours that they put in and the over, and I mean, you know, and people start ",95

2294,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewer,"Do you ever have any, like, special challenges that the with the [REDACTED] and water and getting ",103
2295,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewer,water out to them and anything different from your home? Is it kind of the same deal? ,104
2287,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, kind of about the same? [REDACTED]  ",105
2296,April 22,Interview 27 ,181,1,Interviewer,Wonderful. It’s wonderful. It sounds busy! ,106

2317,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewer,"Affordability wise, does it feel reasonable? You said you’re serviced every two weeks now? [inaudible] ",108
2297,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"Here in [REDACTED] we’re once a month. Just because, you know, we kind of became empty nesters ",109
2298,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"we didn't want to, you know, but when we first were building the house, the family and all that I told my ",110
2299,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"husband, we're having water every week. I can handle everything in [REDACTED], but not when ",111
2300,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,running out of water. So I said that’s the one thing we will not put up with. ,112
2318,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewer,Right ,113
2301,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"The water for the kids, or for laundry. But for the most part we were okay with it doing it once a week ",114
2302,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"but now I mean once a month, but my daughter and grandson are here so I'm kind of a little nervous, if ",115
2303,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"we’ll make it to once a month but yeah, like I said the guys in the cities are real good about you know, if ",116
2304,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"we need another fill up, then fill it up and evac. Really good about that for the most part. ",117
2319,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewer,Yeah. ,118
2305,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,They are some awesome drivers. [inaudible] you know sometimes when you get towards the end of the ,119
2306,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"tank. Yeah, the water sometimes in the bathtub are just a little dingier you know its like, yeah I don’t ",120
2307,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"know if I want to take a bath in there. Oh, wait till the next day after they bring water, sometimes I wait a ",121
2308,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"couple hours too for it to settle. You know, I don't do laundry on water days. It just [inaudible] I don't ",122
2309,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,know if it's my imagination or if it really does happen. But yeah it seems like it stirs the tank up and ,123
2310,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"when we were moving our tank from inside to outside, the new tank when we pulled that thing out. I ",124
2311,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"looked inside our old tank, and I was [inaudible] We were drinking water from this thing? My husband ",125
2312,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"goes, Uh, yeah. Can we you know thoroughly empty the tank sometime and wash it? Rust, oh it was ",126
2313,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,awful I couldn’t believe how yucky it was. Never thought of that in all of the years I lived here. ,127
2320,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewer,Right? You think you get clean water?  ,128
2314,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, well, yeah. And didn’t even think about cleaning that tank out with everything else. No, we kind of ",129
2315,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,got on board with some other people. Cleaning out the tanks a little bit more. [inaudible] what do you ,130
2316,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewee,call that? Thinking of the hoses… ,131
2321,April 22,Interview 27 ,182,1,Interviewer,Power washing? ,132
2322,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewee,Yes power washing. [inaudible] ,133
2330,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewer,"That's one of the things I was going to ask is, you know, once the water is to you, and it's kind of in your ",134
2331,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewer,"system in your home, is there anything that you need to do especially other than, you know, with the ",135
2332,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewer,"sewer, turning it on, turning the heat on? ",136
2323,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewee,"Nope, just the other thing we have to keep up with though was making sure you know, we change out ",137
2324,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewee,the filters.  ,138
2333,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewer,"Filters, sure yeah. ",139
2325,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewee,"The lights come on to indicate that they are pretty plumb full of dirt. Yeah, we do that. That's one thing ",140
2326,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewee,"[inaudible] And then we also make sure you know, wintertime, they often ask us to make sure that ",141
2327,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewee,"getting into the water tank is cleared out. So I'll shovel that out sometimes, or we'll plow it out, you ",142
2328,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewee,"know, around the back tank, so they can get up there and make life a little bit easier for them. And I ",143
2329,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewee,sometimes have to make sure to clean up the [REDACTED]. ,144
2334,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewer,"It’s someone you want to keep on your good side. Yep. Well, are there any questions you have for me? ",145
2335,April 22,Interview 27 ,183,1,Interviewer,Or is there anything I didn't ask you that you want to talk about?  ,146
2364,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewer ,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
2360,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewer,"Sweet. So can you tell me about your water situation here? Do you have the, kind of how do you get ",2
2361,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewer,your water here? ,3
2336,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"Yeah, so I'm on the city hauled water. So I have two 300 gallon plastic storage tanks that are inside my ",4
2337,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"house that are inside my apartment, not outside with just a big pipe that goes to the outside, that the ",5
2338,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"city comes and fills for me. And you can sign up for, like up to twice a week, I think. But I'm on every ",6
2339,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"other week, I get it filled. And I'm pretty rarely below a third of my tank [inaudible] It’s a flat fee, it ",7
2340,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"doesn't matter how much they fill it. It's just you know, one gallon or 600 gallons. It's the same price. It's ",8
2341,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"just how frequently they come to fill it that you pay for. And I use it for everything, for showering, ",9
2342,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"cooking, cleaning, normal house stuff. I don't have, like I don’t think anyone really has like outdoor ",10
2343,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"water [inaudible] It's all just rain and [inaudible], because it's expensive and not a freely available ",11
2344,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,commodity most places. ,12
2362,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewer,"What was that, you were telling me about how it works in your apartment? ",13
2345,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"Yeah, so big water hoppers filled from the outside. They know it's full by an overflow valve. So when it ",14
2346,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"just starts coming back out of the apartment, they turn off the flow. And I have a little electric motor with ",15
2347,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"the priming tank that, once the priming tank, the pressurized priming tank starts to fall off on pressure, it ",16
2348,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,notices and the electric motor repressurizes it with water from the storage tank. ,17
2363,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewer,Okay. How does that work for you? Do you have challenges with it at times? ,18
2349,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"Yeah, I don't run out which is nice. I'm very lucky in that I don't feel like I have to ration very carefully ",19
2350,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"then, and that I can afford to pay for haul service. I don't have to. I don't pay attention to how much I ",20
2351,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"lose which is something that a lot of people, in this community, I think do. More mindful than I was in ",21
2352,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"the Lower 48 I guess. But nah, I don’t really ration. My electric pump gives out about four times a week ",22
2353,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"or which is only really annoying if you're doing laundry or in the shower. You just, you know, walk out ",23
2354,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,and fiddle with a little lever and that works. That's probably more my landlord just not wanting to fix it ,24
2355,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,than a systems problem. I’m sure if you just replaced the pump it’d be fine. The pressure’s pretty good. ,25
2356,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"Pretty normal water heater like I head down south, except for that issue, it works pretty well it seems. ",26
2357,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"The city, sometimes it's delayed but never more than a day or two at the most, and that’s usually like ",27
2358,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,"you know, winter, COVID call outs and all that. So they, I feel like they do a pretty good job of being on ",28
2359,April 22,Interview 28 ,184,2,Interviewee,time with the deliveries. Works okay for me. ,29
2389,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewer,You said you'd been here about [REDACTED]? ,30
2365,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,31
2390,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewer,So have you seen any differences? Kind of? You haven't had a full year yet but seasonality at all? ,32
2366,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, I think again, mine are inside. Yeah. So the biggest thing is I was here for this last winter, is the ",33
2367,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"city can't do anything if your tanks are frozen, or if the line is frozen. So my tanks inside, but both my fill ",34
2368,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"line and overflow line have to go on the outside and that's 40 below, it's easy for those to freeze. So I ",35
2369,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"have a like a, I forgot what’s it called, but it’s just a plugin strip that's over the both metal pipes that plug ",36
2370,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,out of the inside. It's just a heating element. It was just staying on 24/7 simply for for the winter. I think ,37
2371,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"most people a lot of people that have those have them on like a timer switch so they just, or they just ",38
2372,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,have it on a light switch. They just turn them on like the day before the city services are coming just to ,39
2373,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"make sure they are thawed out. Same for the sewer pump out. But that only happened once, that the ",40
2374,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"outlet blew and I didn't notice, so one time this summer or winter they weren’t able to fill my tanks ",41
2375,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"because of the freeze up. That's it, really. ",42
2391,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewer,Nice. You drink the water that's coming right to you. Do you do anything with that? ,43
2376,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"I don't, no. The city I think does, the city made it pretty clear. I think they did a pretty good job ",44
2377,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"communicating that it's tested and that its safe, its clean. It's got a it's got a color, and it's got a flavor. ",45
2378,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"So to me, that's enough to say, I don't think I want to be drinking large quantities of this. So I cook with ",46
2379,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"it, I shower in it and wash my clothes in it. But my drinking water, I have a Big Berkey filter those big like ",47
2380,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"stainless steel, gravity filters, the giant one that I fill like every three days or so. I don't use that for ",48
2381,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,cooking. I'm not so worried about that. But I don't know when it tastes like noticeably funny and when it ,49
2382,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"has a very noticeable yellow color, I’d rather filter that. I don't buy don't buy bottled water, which is what ",50
2383,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"a lot of people do. I bought a Big Berkey, which was expensive. Yeah, but I mean, lasts forever. It's just ",51
2384,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"an expensive initial investment. Yeah, like the carbon filters they have lasts for like 6000 gallons or ",52
2385,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"something like that. That's worked well for me. But I mean, it costs like 400 500 bucks I think. Which is ",53
2386,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"pretty cost prohibitive for a lot of people here. This is actually outside your question, sorry.  ",54
2392,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewer,"No, no. ",55
2387,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"But yeah, [REDACTED] A lot of people don't trust the water and don't think it's healthy. That's actually a ",56
2388,April 22,Interview 28 ,185,1,Interviewee,"big argument people use against like, there's a big conversation [REDACTED], should we do a sugary ",57
2393,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,beverage tax and to try to decrease sugary beverage consumption. So like so many [inaudible] ,58
2394,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"diabetes, dental caries and stuff. And a big argument from the community, right not to do that was well, ",59
2395,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,we can't drink our water. So we got to drink soda.  ,60
2413,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewer,Oh! ,61
2414,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewer,"Ok, cool. ",62
2396,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"So yeah, that's just, it's kind of interesting. And I've had, I told myself, like, you know, just just listen and ",63
2397,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"learn for the first [REDACTED], I'm here. And then try to, you know, put my feelings out there. And it's ",64
2398,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"like, that makes sense, like free to drink the water. And they say, Well, if we can't drink the water and ",65
2399,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"buy juice and soda from the store. If we’re buying something, why waste our money on water? Let's go ",66
2400,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"buy something that tastes good. Like, I see where you're coming from? ",67
2415,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's tough. We've heard that from a few people that they don't like the taste in [inaudible] ",68
2401,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,Yeah.  ,69
2416,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewer,"Can you tell me a little bit more about that? I mean, it is. It's slightly outside, but it's still really relevant to ",70
2417,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewer,"water, [REDACTED]? ",71
2402,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"I think I'm probably not the best person to answer it again [inaudible] But I think that the, I mean, water ",72
2403,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"systems for so long were just like non existent or not safe, that the City hauled water system has been, ",73
2404,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"my understanding it's been in place for a while now for a couple of decades, but only recently maybe ",74
2405,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"have like, quality control. That was like more public as well. People tell me that like, they recently have ",75
2406,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"been trying to advertise more than they know, like, we really do test our water, it’s safe to drink and all ",76
2407,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,that and but its just not trusted in the [inaudible] long term. I think about like or what a lot of people think ,77
2408,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,about spending money [inaudible] to drink orange juice or soda or something that tastes good. There's ,78
2409,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"also this kind of like, you know, it's like the, I don’t know how to say it, just this like perception, I think a ",79
2410,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"little bit that [inaudible]. It's just, it's just better than that.  ",80
2418,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewer,Yeah. That’s tricky. [inaudible] ,81
2411,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"I have been surprised like we have a couple of nice water filters at the [REDACTED], for drinking water. ",82
2412,April 22,Interview 28 ,186,1,Interviewee,"Like the ones you know, the nice ones, where you put your water bottle underneath it. I notice the ",83
2419,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,counters on those are very low as far as like how many how many bottles filled total. So even there like ,84
2420,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,a lot of people are just buying stuff to drink. ,85
2435,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewer,"You think it’s a habit? After a while [inaudible] So you, so your whole system seems to work pretty well ",86
2436,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewer,for you. Do you have any kind of like desire to get piped water? Is that something that you feel like ,87
2437,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewer,could be better for you? ,88
2421,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, I mean, I think that so there's one district in town that has piped water. I think everyone that lives ",89
2422,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,there universally prefers it. Not having to ration I think really is a big deal for a lot of people. And then ,90
2423,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,"there's just there's this hassle of the old water I mean, and make sure your driveway is clean and clear ",91
2424,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,"when they come, you have to make sure that your pipes are maintained for pump in and for overflow. I ",92
2425,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,"don't know anything from the engineering side about like quality control, but I would imagine that maybe ",93
2426,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,"it's a little bit easier to do quality control on that, kinda closed circuit supply and then the whole water ",94
2427,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,supply.  ,95
2438,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewer,"And yeah, it's a little different. You don't have a person, you know, dragging something through mud at ",96
2439,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewer,"any time and then the operators [inaudible] really great, but there’s just more people [inaudible] open ",97
2440,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewer,air?  ,98
2428,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,"For sure. No, I think that would be, especially with just the winter conditions here. Although I think all of ",99
2429,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,it I think all the city water and city stuff is above ground. And all of that type of water. It's especially ,100
2430,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,interesting. Fact of life in the tundra I guess.  ,101
2441,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewer,Yes.  ,102
2431,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,Yeah. Apparently the permafrost is like going away. ,103
2442,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewer,Right. We've heard a lot of that. Yeah. ,104
2432,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,"But yeah, I think, I think that'd be a lot of, I’d prefer to be on hauled water. Or sorry, I mean piped water. ",105
2433,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,"But I just bought a house in town that’s on hauled water. So obviously, it wasn't the biggest sort of ",106
2434,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewee,breaking point for me. ,107
2443,April 22,Interview 28 ,187,1,Interviewer,"So it'd be a plus, but it’s not a decisionmaker. ",108
2444,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,109
2445,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,Thanks. ,110
2464,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewer,"Exciting. Um, so while you're renting right now, when something goes wrong, is it your landlord that is ",111
2465,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewer,mostly going to fix things? And how do you anticipate that once you don’t have that? ,112
2446,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,113
2447,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,And I've I've just been a little frustrated with that stuff. Like it's just everyone that just tells me and I'm ,114
2448,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,getting more used to it that it’s just a little bit different. And I think it's that things happen a little bit ,115
2449,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"different here. Like my you know, like if my pump has been broken for the six months I've lived in this ",116
2450,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"place, and four times a week that I have to go you know, restart it and turn it back on. And the first ",117
2451,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"couple of weeks that infuriated me, and my landlord was like, ‘Maybe after the winter I'll take a look but ",118
2452,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"just fill this switch and it works so to me that means it's not broken.’ But you know, he said to me, it's ",119
2453,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"like well, you know, when I'm in the shower and it turns off and I'm trying to get to work or if I’m you ",120
2454,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"know burning out the motor on the washing machine because it's not you know, sucking water and it's a ",121
2455,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,little bit annoying that like house not falling over but a little bit broken. And that kind of stuff is just you ,122
2456,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"know, pretty normal and acceptable I think and I have a pretty good landlord it's still, he’s always like, ",123
2457,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"that's that's not gonna, not gonna fix that. Sorry. Yeah, well okay, I guess I'm just gonna live with that. ",124
2466,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewer,Gotta pick and choose your battles. ,125
2458,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,Yeah. There's there's just not a lot of resources to fix things I think. We can't really call like the plumber ,126
2459,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"who's like, you know? I think no, I don't think there's any like, like professional, there’s a couple of great ",127
2460,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,contractors but not like utilities peoples that you call. It's just know a guy that knows a guy that might be ,128
2461,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"able to come over and fix it or order a new part for me, which is really expensive. So in the winter, it all ",129
2462,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,"has to be flown out, barged out this summer. So it’s expensive to do that stuff. [REDACTED]  ",130
2467,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. ,131
2463,April 22,Interview 28 ,188,1,Interviewee,Don’t know a good way to say that. ,132
2482,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewer,"I’m seeing if there's anything else that I haven't asked. Affordability wise, you know, typically, it sounds ",133
2483,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewer,"like generally you're kind of okay, but recognizing that are not always affordable things? ",134
2468,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,"I left my phone in my truck, I was gonna look up the utility bill. I think my hauled water and sewer is I ",135
2469,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,"think around like 180 to 200 a month, which I'm honestly kind of last lost track of how that compares to ",136
2470,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,"Lower 48. I’m very lucky that I have a great job, I don't have to worry too much about the cost of ",137
2471,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,"utilities. I think that that is something that is prioritized by community members that are on budget, just ",138
2472,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,"making sure that you have all the services set up. But yeah, I can't speak too much to how cost ",139
2473,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,"prohibitive that is for people. I also don't know much about, this is interesting. I don't know how much of ",140
2474,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,"that is subsidized. So I would have I was like that's actually doesn't seem that expensive, you know, ",141
2475,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,"that level of personnel and equipment and everything, but it's less than 200 a month so I wonder how ",142
2476,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,much of that is subsidized through state or city programs?  ,143
2484,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewer,That's a great question.  ,144
2477,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,I don’t really know how stuff gets paid for around here. We don't have property taxes I just learned. I ,145
2478,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewee,just don't really know how stuff like that is paid for. Is that usually how utilities are paid for? ,146
2485,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's a really good point. And I know that you mentioned I haven't, we've heard little bits and ",147
2486,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewer,"pieces of lots of different things. But as far as those who can afford it, we really haven't heard much. ",148
2487,April 22,Interview 28 ,189,1,Interviewer,"We've heard that it is a lot for some, but not really what they do about that. ",149

2492,April 22,Interview 28 ,190,1,Interviewee,"No, I think that the, I think there's the biggest thing definitely, [REDACTED]. It's just that lack of trust of ",157
2493,April 22,Interview 28 ,190,1,Interviewee,"quality, or too much concerns about the actual, like cost or systems breaking down and just the quality ",158
2494,April 22,Interview 28 ,190,1,Interviewee,"of water and that is like just a pretty universally not trusted, it seems like from most people I’ve talked ",159
2495,April 22,Interview 28 ,190,1,Interviewee,to. ,160
2515,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewer ,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
2508,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewer,"Yeah. Nice. Nice. Cool. Okay, so you live on you have piped water, right? ",2

2509,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewer,"Okay, okay, and moving here, and there wasn't like a shift to have to learn how to deal with hauled ",4
2510,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewer,water?  ,5
2497,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,"Yeah, definitely. I didn't know that that was gonna be a thing when I accepted this job. I like didn't really, ",6
2498,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,"maybe I should have asked my questions, like I knew the costs of living were gonna be high, but I didn’t ",7
2499,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,realize that [inaudible] was gonna be the bathroom. ,8
2511,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay. And so what what were some of the like, learning kind of trials was that as you had to kind ",9
2512,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewer,of figure out how to deal with it? ,10
2500,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,"Well, let’ see. I mean, I think that like the city can be, the city is often understaffed and I think that can ",11
2501,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,"lead to miscommunication when accounts are switched, when anything is changed in an account and ",12
2502,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,"so like when I switched it from my landlord’s name to my name [inaudible] skip a service, so like, ",13
2503,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,"remember to skip it, but forget to [inaudible]. So when I switched over, there was like, a couple of ",14
2504,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,"weeks where I like didn’t get water and like, would like to wait up for the water, or, like, come to my ",15
2505,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,"neighborhood. Like, look out the window, like, get up early, like watch for this, [inaudible] like run down ",16
2506,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,"the street and be like, [inaudible] ",17
2513,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewer,Whoa! ,18
2507,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewee,That happened in like the first week. ,19
2514,April 22,Interview 29 ,191,2,Interviewer,What did you do without water in the interim?  ,20
2516,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,I think it was like a little bit less where the [inaudible] in my house you can sort of see the level. They're ,21
2517,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,"not like, they're like fairly opaque, but you can kind of see. So I had like enough like, but I like couldn’t ",22
2518,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,"take a shower. I’m not sure if I showered at the gym or not, maybe I showered at work. But I [inaudible] ",23
2519,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,around piped water and there’s like an apartment up there. So things have never gotten like too dire for ,24
2520,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,me. ,25
2529,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay, good. And how’s the taste, do you notice anything different in the taste of it or in the color ",26
2530,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewer,of it? ,27
2521,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,"I use a [inaudible] filter so I don’t, but I also could have gotten used to it. ",28
2531,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, so is that for the water you're, all the water you're using in the house? Or just the water you're ",29
2532,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewer,drinking that you use the filter on?  ,30
2522,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,"Just the water I’m drinking, but like if I cook with it too, or actually I do notice like it smells more ",31
2523,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,chemically. I've never heard this term before but off gassing?  ,32
2533,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewer,Yes. ,33
2524,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,I didn't know that. And that's a term I learned like really quickly. The first few days after it's been ,34
2525,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,"delivered. It's more like chemical-y. And so I try to not use it like in like my sourdough starter, or ",35
2526,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED]. ,36
2534,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. ,37
2527,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,And I don't want it to [inaudible] the chemical. ,38
2535,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewer,Have you found that it does if you do that? ,39
2528,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewee,It probably doesn’t. ,40
2536,April 22,Interview 29 ,192,1,Interviewer,Right but like you don’t know. ,41
2537,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,"I’m probably being extra cautious, but I don’t want the chemicals to interfere with the [inaudible] ",42
2551,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewer,"Oh totally, oh interesting I hadn’t thought of that.  ",43
2538,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,"It might be just like, you know? ",44
2552,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewer,"No, like noticing [inaudible] Off gassing is definitely something that we've heard. So, okay, so have you ",45
2553,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewer,"had any issues with frozen pipes, you've been here over a year so frozen pipes in the winter? ",46
2539,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,[inaudible] ,47
2554,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, what do you do with that? ",48
2540,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,Oh God let's see I had I didn't have I didn't have water to my bathroom for like almost two months this ,49
2541,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,winter. And my landlords have like a compound across the way that I can go shower in and I just like ,50
2542,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,"like use a honey bucket number one, and number two I'd like go to their place across the way yeah, ",51
2543,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED]. ,52
2544,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, I think it was like, yeah, either like seven weeks or eight weeks or something like that. ",53
2555,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewer,And it’s because the pipes were frozen?  ,54
2545,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, and then they actually replaced the pipe. Got a new tank. I guess like the way that they've set up ",55
2546,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,the piping. [REDACTED].  ,56
2556,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewer,"Okay, cool.  ",57
2547,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] So in order for like the stuff to get like from the shower and from the toilet, have to like ",58
2548,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,travel quite a long way to jump out into the sewer. So I think that's how it was mainly all freezing. And ,59
2549,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,"then my landlords their new pipes built, welded, and it basically sits right under, sorry, I guess this is ",60
2550,April 22,Interview 29 ,193,1,Interviewee,interesting to you. ,61
2568,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewer,"No, no, it is, I am here to listen. It’s not too much! Hit me with it. ",62
2557,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,63
2569,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewer,"Oh, no. ",64
2558,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,So I'm not sure like we'd have like a little space heater that was set up next to the toilet because my ,65
2559,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,"landlord was like, oh, like there's the pipe has like about this much that that is exposed. Like has no ",66
2560,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,insulation on it because he like couldn't do it till the summer. And so you put like a space heater on ,67
2561,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,super low right next to the toilet.  ,68
2570,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewer,Okay. It was helping keeping the pipe.  ,69
2562,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,Yeah. And I don't know if she moved it or like turned it off or something. Or I forgot to tell her. It was ,70
2563,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,weird [inaudible] I only found out like through someone else like last week. I don't know what happened ,71
2564,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,in that situation.  ,72
2571,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewer,So was the landlord responsible at the end of the day for all of those fixes?  ,73
2565,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, financially yeah. ",74
2572,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewer,And logistically? ,75
2566,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,And I got a break on like rent. ,76
2573,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewer,"Okay, good. Good. Okay. Is it so in addition to like dealing with some of the hassles of it? How did they ",77
2574,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewer,"were they like, tough it through, like, make a plan to get through the couple of months and then we'll fix ",78
2575,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewer,it when the [inaudible] melted.  ,79
2567,April 22,Interview 29 ,194,1,Interviewee,"Like how, [REDACTED] ",80
2590,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, like, what are the solutions there? Are there ways to melt the pipe? Like how do you do, if its ",81
2591,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewer,"frozen, is it too far? It's gone too late.  ",82
2576,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,Basically. ,83
2592,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, I'm going to wait.  ",84
2577,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,One time. [REDACTED]  ,85
2593,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewer,Before you or with you? ,86
2578,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,With me here. And he’s kind of like [REDACTED]. He’s fine to like crawl under the place [inaudible] So I ,87
2579,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,"guess what had happened before after the new tank was installed is that like, you turn on the new ",88
2580,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,"shower, you turn on the shower, and then if the pipes were cold, the water was cold like for the there's ",89
2581,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,"a pipe for cold the water cold like for the first few seconds comes out, it hits the frozen pipe, a really ",90
2582,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,cold pipe and then [inaudible] ,91
2594,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewer,"Oh ice, okay. ",92
2583,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,"So we got like some ice buildup but that was able to be, I like called my landlord about it. Like, he's like, ",93
2584,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,"you gotta go under there with a hairdryer. My [REDACTED] took my hairdryer, and a couple it was like ",94
2585,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,"a couple minutes later, actually no it wasn’t. No, he like set it up under there with some like tinfoil and ",95
2586,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,like a light. ,96
2595,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewer,Like a whole contraption?  ,97
2587,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, he made a whole contraption. Ran it for a bit. And then it melted, I think only a little bit of ice ",98
2588,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,[inaudible]. ,99
2596,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewer,"Okay, man. That's a lot to deal with though. ",100
2589,April 22,Interview 29 ,195,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,101
2612,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. So did you have the same issues last year? I heard this happened to be a really rough ,102
2613,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewer,winter in general.  ,103
2597,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,I wanna say [inaudible]. But I think last year because we had that different system. And there was like ,104
2598,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"the system that my landlord had done when they had lived in the [REDACTED], which was to like, pour ",105
2599,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,a bucket of hot water down the toilet when they flush. Like once a day. Every so often. ,106
2614,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewer,Okay. Kind of keep it moving. ,107
2600,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, and I hadn't done that. That at that point, it was another like, at least month without. So I’ve had ",108
2601,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,at least three months without full running water in total. ,109
2615,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewer,"Wow that’s hard. So if you can say I mean, is getting onto the piped system. Would that be ideal?  ",110
2602,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,Yeah. For me I think. Though for cost. Though I know people have issues with it around town. And I ,111
2603,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"know, yeah, I guess, you know, [REDACTED]. But a lot of people don't actually want it and it actually is ",112
2604,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"coming to like, stopping like three blocks before my neighborhood. [REDACTED] ",113
2616,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. ",114
2605,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, [inaudible] like a lot of people really think it's ugly. People don’t like that it’s above ground. And ",115
2606,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"obviously, there are lots of neighborhoods where it [inaudible] really bad. I think the general consensus ",116
2607,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"is that hauled water is like cleaner. So I don't know if that's true because when I talked to like, ",117
2608,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] and like, looked into things like that. It seems like, basically, the more often water is ",118
2609,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"exposed, the more the higher the chances are of it getting contaminated. So even though hauled water ",119
2610,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,"may taste cleaner, I’m not convinced that it actually is from like a public health perspective. ",120
2617,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewer,"[REDACTED] So in terms of so similar criticism, criticism that you'd hear on pipes is maybe like the ",121
2618,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewer,visual look of the pipe.  ,122
2611,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewee,You have the look. ,123
2619,April 22,Interview 29 ,196,1,Interviewer,You have a taste?  ,124
2620,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. I mean, I think that the two are sort of inextricably linked. ",125
2633,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah.  ,126
2621,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"You know, if it looks brown, and you’re looking at it, even if it taste like nothing. [inaudible] ",127
2634,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's fair. And what about like the look of the pipes like in the [inaudible] ",128
2635,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewer,Just being able to see the pipes on the ground and that kind of thing.  ,129
2622,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, people don't like that.  ",130
2636,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, I don’t blame them. ",131
2623,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"I don't think like anybody who lives in [REDACTED] [inaudible] In my personal opinion, it's like ",132
2624,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"whatever, like I don’t care. It seems like a better way to get water, but. ",133
2637,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah, no that’s fair. And if you get, so if you could change anything for [REDACTED]’s water ",134
2638,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewer,"system, what do you think would be some of the good changes? Like getting everyone on piped? Is ",135
2639,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewer,that what a good direction to go? Or?  ,136
2625,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"It's, it seems so I mean, I think that like, there this is something that I don't know as much about but like ",137
2626,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"there's some neighborhoods, I'm sure you've heard of housing that have really bad piped water, or it's ",138
2627,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"just brown or like, you know, the city runs tests on water. So there was actually a point where like, there ",139
2628,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"was some contaminants over the past year. But normally, it's like pretty good I think. I don't know how it ",140
2629,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,stacks up with other cities. It seems like the best option as long as they can address like the color ,141
2630,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"[inaudible] really off putting. And like yeah, obviously yeah, like housing is like [inaudible] So that’s ",142
2631,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"super problematic. I think it’s just like, if they can address equity within the piping system, and then like ",143
2632,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewee,"expanded, yeah, that would be the best.  ",144
2640,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. No I think that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Okay. Is there anything I should have asked ",145
2641,April 22,Interview 29 ,197,1,Interviewer,you that I didn't think ask or that you think we should know?  ,146
2642,April 22,Interview 29 ,198,1,Interviewee,"I think yeah, I think that about covers it.  ",147
2643,April 22,Interview 29 ,198,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, we'll be here all day. That's great. Thank you. ",148
2651,April 22,Interview 3 ,12,2,Interviewer,"Okay, awesome so can you tell me a little bit about yourself? What's your name? And where do you ",1
2652,April 22,Interview 3 ,12,2,Interviewer,live? ,2

2654,April 22,Interview 3 ,12,2,Interviewer,"You're going straight to work. Well, thanks for taking a little bit of time to do that with us. I know you're ",6
2655,April 22,Interview 3 ,12,2,Interviewer,"probably probably tired. But so first question is, you know, how do you use water day to day? ",7
2646,April 22,Interview 3 ,12,2,Interviewee,"We have running water. We use, we use it for laundry, washing dishes. We wash subsistence foods in ",8
2647,April 22,Interview 3 ,12,2,Interviewee,it. ,9
2656,April 22,Interview 3 ,12,2,Interviewer,"Yeah. Great. So it's piped water, then you have like a faucet and a flush toilet.  ",10
2648,April 22,Interview 3 ,12,2,Interviewee,"Yes, mm-hmm. ",11
2657,April 22,Interview 3 ,12,2,Interviewer,"Okay, great. How long have you had that? Has it been a long time? Or?  ",12

2661,April 22,Interview 3 ,13,1,Interviewee,"It’s way better, and we don't need to do more stuff just to get water from the river or in the winter get ice ",19
2662,April 22,Interview 3 ,13,1,Interviewee,for water. ,20
2669,April 22,Interview 3 ,13,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, so it's a lot easier. Now. ",21

2686,April 22,Interview 3 ,14,1,Interviewer,Yeah. ,39
2679,April 22,Interview 3 ,14,1,Interviewee,And it ruins the pipes. ,40

2680,April 22,Interview 3 ,14,1,Interviewee,"We call our water sewer people, and they come and fix it.  ",42
2688,April 22,Interview 3 ,14,1,Interviewer,Okay. ,43

2682,April 22,Interview 3 ,14,1,Interviewee,"But if it’s on the inside, we won’t get charged. ",46
2690,April 22,Interview 3 ,14,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay, that makes sense. And then you pay a water bill earlier.  ",47

2701,April 22,Interview 3 ,15,1,Interviewer,"Okay, so that's a large. Yeah, that's expensive. Okay. So, you'd like you think it'd be better to be a little ",54

2695,April 22,Interview 3 ,15,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,56
2703,April 22,Interview 3 ,15,1,Interviewer,But do you think it's worth the money for having high water compared to what you used to have?  ,57

2704,April 22,Interview 3 ,15,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. Is there anything you particularly like about your water system? ",59

2706,April 22,Interview 3 ,15,1,Interviewer,"Okay, yeah. ",63
2707,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewee,"And for hot water we use, snow boil. Heating fuel, to heat up the water. ",64

2716,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewer,"Okay, great. Awesome. And then, you know, so do you ever worry about the water being safe to drink ",67
2717,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewer,or not? ,68
2709,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewee,"No, because I know it's always tested. I work in the [REDACTED] and they come to the [REDACTED] ",69

2719,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, okay. That’s awesome. Do you notice issues with like how it tastes or smells? ",73
2712,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewee,[inaudible; likely “no”] But on the old side of the village they have question how – and it’s stinky and – ,74
2720,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. ",75
2713,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewee,I don't like drinking that because it tastes like chlorine or something. Very strong.  ,76

2714,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative). ,78
2722,April 22,Interview 3 ,16,1,Interviewer,And they haul it. ,79

2731,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewer,"Okay, so it's part of the part of your village has pipe and part doesn't.  ",83
2725,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative). ,84
2732,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewer,"Okay, got it. ",85
2733,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewer,Do you hope that they'll eventually have pipes everywhere? ,86
2726,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewee,Yes. Mm-hmm. ,87
2734,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewer,Do you think most people feel like that? Like does your mom want piped too? ,88
2727,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, she’d rather have running water than flush and haul. ",89
2735,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. So you wouldn't drink the water at your-  ",90
2728,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewee,No. ,91
2736,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewer,You just use ice melt or burn water.  ,92

2737,April 22,Interview 3 ,17,1,Interviewer,"Okay, got it. So do you ever have times where you don't have water like your water system goes out?  ",94
2738,April 22,Interview 3 ,18,1,Interviewee,[inaudible; likely “no”]. We’ve never had that problem. ,95
2740,April 22,Interview 3 ,18,1,Interviewer,"That's awesome. That's great. Yeah, is there any other kind of – it'll do short and sweet, so there's not ",96
2741,April 22,Interview 3 ,18,1,Interviewer,"many more questions – but is there any other kind of thoughts about water or, or anything you think I ",97
2742,April 22,Interview 3 ,18,1,Interviewer,should have asked you and didn’t.  ,98
2739,April 22,Interview 3 ,18,1,Interviewee,I don’t think so. ,99

2754,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 3 ,And I don’t see why the water and sewer project inspectors don’t [inaudible] I’m not sure if they made a ,3
2755,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 3 ,change. But then the whole system needs to be [inaudible] if you’re reflecting only on [REDACTED] or ,4
2756,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 3 ,"any other village, then [inaudible] the village. ",5
2760,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewer,"Okay, so the pipes are old, and there’s a lot of rust in them. ",6
2757,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 3 ,Those housing areas. ,7
2761,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewer,It’s on piped water right? It’s all fully on piped? ,8
2758,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 3 ,Yeah ,9
2762,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewer,Are you guys on piped? ,10
2745,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 2,I grew up on hauled water. My parents they got connected to city water [inaudible] and it is severely ,11
2746,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 2,"overloaded with chlorine. You can, my dad will run the water for 15 to 20 minutes just to keep get the ",12
2747,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 2,"chlorine, otherwise [inaudible] like when we lived in [REDACTED] we hauled our own water, a lot of ",13
2748,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 2,"times we went, her dad, my father-in-law. And he was on piped water [inaudible] village and we’d carry ",14
2749,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 2,"all our containers and you could taste the chlorine. Every couple of days we’d have to change, or wash ",15
2750,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 2,out our water containers because they’d fill up with [inaudible] ,16
2763,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. ",17
2744,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 1,My dad’s water was [inaudible] under the sink ,18
2751,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 2,[inaudible] hooked up in line. So he had [inaudible] when I went out. So he had three filters all in line ,19
2752,April 22,Interview 30 ,199,2,Interviewee 2,[inaudible]. He added extra ones for the chlorine and he could still smell it in the water. ,20
2774,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewer,And taste it? Okay. ,21
2766,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 2,"And our father, my father-in-law, her dad, in [REDACTED], he can’t, they don’t like drinking the water ",22
2767,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 2,"from the pipes, so they’ll go out to the river and punch a hole in the ice and haul back the water from ",23
2768,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 2,the river water. ,24
2764,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 1,Or rain water. ,25
2769,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 2,Or rain water. ,26
2775,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, tastes better. So you’re both on hauled right now, here? ",27
2765,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 1,"No, we just came for my [REDACTED]. ",28
2776,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewer,Got it. Got it. Okay. ,29
2770,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 2,We [inaudible] on hauled and piped. ,30
2777,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewer,And so what do you prefer? ,31
2771,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 2,"Hauled water, I prefer the hauled water. ",32
2778,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewer,Does it taste a little less chlorine-y? ,33
2772,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 2,Yeah. ,34
2779,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewer,Than the piped one? ,35
2773,April 22,Interview 30 ,200,1,Interviewee 2,"Yeah, the chlorine one in my dad’s house, nobody’s [inaudible] they settle in the lowest part of the pipe. ",36
2789,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,Got it. ,37
2780,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewee 2,"So that’s why my dad runs it for 15, 20 minutes try to get the water flowing. ",38
2790,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,"Moving. Okay, yeah yeah. So the hauled is the same water from the system but its like not through the ",39
2791,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,"pipe. Got it. Got it. Got it no that makes sense. So in between the hauled and the piped, what apart ",40
2792,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,"from the chlorine taste, is there any other cost benefits or any other kind of convenience benefits? ",41
2781,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewee 2,The hauled water is way more expensive. The piped water here I think [inaudible] flat rate. But it just ,42
2782,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewee 2,depends on how big your tanks are. You could be paying upwards of 200 dollars a month [inaudible] ,43
2783,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewee 2,every week. ,44
2793,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,"Wow, that’s a lot. ",45
2784,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewee 2,It was different when we were in the middle of hauling our own water. ,46
2794,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,"No, I’m sure. So if you moved back to [REDACTED] would you go for a hauled or a piped system you ",47
2795,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,think? ,48
2785,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewee 2,"I’d probably go on a piped system, but add lots of filters. Lots of filters. ",49
2796,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. And so that’s because of the convenience of it and the cost of it. ",50
2786,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewee 2,Yeah. [inaudible] and you don’t have to worry about it. Unless the pipes break or burst. ,51
2797,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,"Which, have you had broken or frozen pipes? ",52
2787,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewee 2,You see them every year. I don’t think we’ve had [inaudible] pipes burst there was none in the city but ,53

2798,April 22,Interview 30 ,201,1,Interviewer,"Yup, yup. And have you had issues with your pipes in housing? ",55
2805,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 3 ,"Well, not really those [inaudible] or water but the metal that can rust, they [inaudible] change into plastic ",56
2806,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 3 ,"[inaudible] only problem there is where they put chlorine, is it, and depending on how strong it is, they ",57
2807,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 3 ,"could make it [inaudible] without them. The whole water pipe [inaudible] however they can, maybe how ",58
2808,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 3 ,he said it [inaudible] ,59
2815,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. So do you prefer piped or hauled water? ",60
2809,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 3 ,"Doesn’t matter, nature’s nature wherever it came from. Because it’s spreading all over regardless of it’s ",61
2810,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 3 ,"a village or a small hub or area, you know. Sometimes can be bad. And then the water can be really ",62
2811,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 3 ,bad due to [inaudible] chemicals and stuff [inaudible] ,63
2816,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. If you could change [inaudible] ",64
2812,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 3 ,"I would change how [inaudible] For steam baths, there’s many ways they haul the water from the river, ",65

2817,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. That’s a different water path to take. If could change anything about the water system here ",68

2799,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 2,[inaudible] my father-in-law. He’s on city water in [REDACTED] and my dad’s on city water here. You ,70
2800,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 2,"can’t really get away from the chlorine and all that other stuff. But, like him and my brother-in-law they ",71
2801,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 2,"still go out to the river and they’ll haul water from the river or rainwater. Too much chlorine. And here, ",72
2802,April 22,Interview 30 ,202,1,Interviewee 2,"what was it, was it a couple months ago? [inaudible] They were testing levels of some kind of ",73

2830,April 22,Interview 30 ,203,1,Interviewee 2,"because it reduces the cost of having to have the city haul it for them. So, [inaudible] pull up to the ",94
2831,April 22,Interview 30 ,203,1,Interviewee 2,"plant, and just fill up the tank in the back of their truck, and then pump it into their tank in there house.  ",95
2839,April 22,Interview 30 ,203,1,Interviewer,How many people do you think do it like ,96
2840,April 22,Interview 30 ,204,1,Interviewee 2,"If you’re here long enough, you’ll see trucks running around, just a regular pick up truck with a giant ",97
2841,April 22,Interview 30 ,204,1,Interviewee 2,plastic tank ,98
2844,April 22,Interview 30 ,204,1,Interviewer,"That’s it, that’s it. ",99
2842,April 22,Interview 30 ,204,1,Interviewee 2,"Yep. And that just helps, they still gotta because it’s a hauled system, they still have septic systems. So ",100
2843,April 22,Interview 30 ,204,1,Interviewee 2,they still gotta watch that. But it reduces their costs. ,101
2852,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, how do you find the water? So what kind of system are you on here in [REDACTED]? ",1
2845,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewee,We live on the piped water. ,2
2853,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewer,Okay. And you were you were starting to say that you don't like it. ,3
2846,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewee,"Yeah, I don't like the water. ",4
2854,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewer,Is it? What don't you like about it? ,5
2847,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewee,I think it's gross. ,6
2855,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewer,Yeah. ,7
2848,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewee,Before it used to be rusty. Now it smells like Clorox. ,8
2856,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewer,It smells like Clorox? Do you taste it too? ,9
2849,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewee,I don’t drink it. ,10
2857,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewer,"Don’t drink it, okay. So what do you drink? ",11
2850,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewee,I buy my water. ,12
2858,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewer,"Okay, yeah so, hauled water, or bottled water? ",13
2851,April 22,Interview 31 ,205,2,Interviewee,Bottled water. ,14
2866,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewer,"Okay, and to shower and that kind of thing, what do you do? ",15
2859,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewee,Well I use that to shower. ,16
2867,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewer,"Okay, the piped water? ",17
2860,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewee,"For drinking and cooking, we buy the water. ",18
2868,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewer,Are you from [REDACTED] or? ,19
2861,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED] ,20
2869,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewer,Okay. Nice. And so have you always been on the piped system? Or did you start on the hauled ,21
2870,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewer,system? ,22
2862,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewee,"Always, always on the piped. ",23
2871,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewer,Has it gotten? Has it changed over time?  ,24
2863,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewee,Yeah.  ,25
2872,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewer,Has it gotten better or gotten worse? ,26
2864,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewee,I think it's the same.  ,27
2873,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewer,Okay.  ,28
2865,April 22,Interview 31 ,206,1,Interviewee,"Well, it's not like it used to be. ",29
2880,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,Okay.  ,30
2874,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewee,It used to be rusty. We used to have brown water. You could smell the rust. Now it smells like Clorox. ,31
2881,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,"Okay, so what is that, an improvement? Or is that? I mean you don't use it, so that sounds like it's not a ",32
2882,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,"good, good thing.  ",33
2875,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewee,I boil it before I wash dishes with it.  ,34
2883,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,"And then that takes a lot of electricity, right to boil it. Okay, and so what what's the biggest use of water ",35
2884,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,in your household? What do you mainly use? ,36
2876,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewee,Everything. ,37
2885,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,"Everything, yeah, yeah. ",38
2877,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewee,"Cooking, cleaning,  ",39
2886,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,"Eating, showering, everything.  ",40
2878,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewee,We have a big house. ,41
2887,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] ,42
2888,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,Are there things that you like about your system? Or what would you change? If you could change ,43
2889,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,"something about it, what would you change? ",44
2879,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewee,Drinking water. ,45
2890,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Would you keep it? Would you keep it as piped and just take away the chlorine smell? Or what ,46
2891,April 22,Interview 31 ,207,1,Interviewer,would you? ,47
2892,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewee,"I don't know. Is there another way to get water besides having the piped water? Well, actually, I do. I ",48
2893,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewee,was living in [inaudible] ,49
2901,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. Did you like the well system? ",50
2894,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewee,The water was easier to filter. ,51
2902,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay, and did it taste better? ",52
2895,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewee,"Mmhmm, a lot better. ",53
2903,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewer,Did you have to go in and use [inaudible] ,54
2896,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewee,No the  ,55
2904,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewer,It was still hauled? Like the water delivery would? ,56
2897,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewee,Well there was actually no delivery. It actually was like an old well system that they were using. ,57
2898,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewee,[inaudible] ,58
2905,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewer,Got it. And do you prefer that kind of system because of the pace. ,59
2899,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewee,"Yes, mmhmm. ",60
2906,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewer,Did it come in piped? ,61
2900,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewee,It was [inaudible] It’s filtered already. ,62
2907,April 22,Interview 31 ,208,1,Interviewer,And that helps to [inaudible] for everything too. ,63
2908,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewee,[inaudible] the management [inaudible] ,64
2912,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay got it. That makes sense. ",65
2909,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewee,But I don't think they have that type of good water. ,66
2913,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay. This was some ground what, like the source water is not clean? ",67
2910,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewee,Not as good as the well where I was [inaudible] ,68
2914,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewer,"Okay, that makes sense. [REDACTED] ",69
2915,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. So what do you think about the new piping that like if more people are moving on to piped ",70
2916,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewer,water? Is that a good thing? Or what do you think? ,71
2911,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, I think its that or water delivery. [inaudible] better than the piped water. ",72
2917,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewer,Okay that makes sense. I'm going out of my head here. I think I hit all of our questions. Let me just ,73
2918,April 22,Interview 31 ,209,1,Interviewer,make sure I haven’t missed any. ,74
2929,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewer,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
2930,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewer,"Nice, that’s a good place to be. And what do you feel about water? How's your water system here and ",2
2931,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewer,is it reliable? What do you are you on piped or hauled? ,3
2919,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,I am on piped water. I did rent a haul water situation that wasn’t that bad. Just had to watch. ,4
2932,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewer,The levels? ,5
2920,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,"Yeah. [REDACTED] The only thing hooked up when you had hot water held water, the only thing ",6
2921,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,hooked up to your sewer tank that got evacuated was the toilet. The other water just went off to the ,7
2922,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,tundra.  ,8
2933,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewer,Okay. ,9
2923,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,"Okay, [inaudible; likely “stopped that”]. And every all everything you use the water goes to the sewer ",10
2924,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,"tank. Okay. So that's the hauled water situation. The piped water situation, the pipes are old. And ",11
2925,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,"where I live, the pipes are very old. But they work and I have a circulation piped system. ",12
2934,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewer,In the house? ,13
2926,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,"It's outside of the house. My house, the pipes, it's a long way from the main. So I have a circulation ",14
2927,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,"pump and a heat tape system, it goes to the main from the exterior of my house. ",15
2935,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewer,"And so if that happens to freezes, does it hit back to the main pipe or just ",16
2928,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewee,"No, if that happens to freeze. I'm, it's just my house. ",17
2936,April 22,Interview 32 ,210,2,Interviewer,"Just your house, okay, okay. ",18
2937,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"And it's not even, we can't even thaw it, you just have to replace the pipes. Now, my neighbors that ",19
2938,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"have [REDACTED], they don't have that intricate system, but they're just told to leave the water ",20
2939,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"running. And if they don't, and I had a neighbor with little kids that turned off the faucet, you know, they ",21
2940,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,don't know that this were a little kid. They had to have it replaced. ,22
2955,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewer,"Oh, that’s and how often do you think that, I mean, does that impact people often? ",23
2941,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"Oh, you just have to be on top of that. I had another neighbor this past winter. Somehow, you know, ",24
2942,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"when the pipes burst, they freeze and expand, and then when it thaws, unless you shut off the main, ",25
2943,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,the water will keep running. So I did have a neighbor. And I had this a couple years ago with another ,26
2944,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"neighbor, where there was just a skirt of icicles around the house. All the way around. So you knew ",27
2945,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,what happened. ,28
2956,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewer,"Oh no, the whole thing had flooded? ",29
2946,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, so the flooring and insulation and everything. I've had frozen pipes, but I turned off the main until ",30
2947,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"the pipes got fixed. But if you don't do that, that's what happens ",31
2957,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay, and so did you replace when your pipes froze? Did you replace it? ",32
2948,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, they replaced and soldered, but then it happened again. So we replaced them with plastic pipe. ",33
2949,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,Plastic pipes can freeze easily so I have to really insulate and keep on top of that. ,34
2958,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewer,With the heat with the heat tracers that you said? ,35
2950,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"Oh, I don't have heat tapes inside. I have, I'm gonna insulate it a little bit better. I took out where I saw ",36
2951,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,the weak point was and insulated it but I'm gonna insulate it better because I think that was the area. ,37
2952,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"But this past winter, it was fine. There was when you use plastic pipes, you use them because they ",38
2953,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,"don't break when they freeze. They can expand. But the tradeoff is they can freeze [funny 03:34], easy. ",39
2959,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewer,"Okay. So when did you when your whole set of pipes froze, did you replace it? Or did someone come in ",40
2960,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewer,and replace it for you? ,41
2954,April 22,Interview 32 ,211,1,Interviewee,I had I had a certified plumber do it. ,42
2971,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay, that makes sense. But then then some of that kind of installation. You said you were ",43
2972,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewer,doing?  ,44
2961,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,I can do that. Stuff I can do. ,45
2973,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. And so in terms of the quality of water, do you like the piped water? Does it taste okay? ",46
2962,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,"It varies. It's different times of the year. It varies, and sometimes they're flushing the pipes, or if they ",47
2963,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,"shut them off to work on something, they can be kind of funny colored. ",48
2974,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewer,Is the variation seasonal? ,49
2964,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,"Oh, I don’t have a pattern to it. I have the filters. I have filters. ",50
2975,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewer,"Okay, so nice. Okay. Inside your house with filters?  ",51
2965,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,Yeah. I have one for the hot water. And one for all the water when it comes in. ,52
2976,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewer,Got it. Got it. Okay. And are there things that you would change about the piped system or about your ,53
2977,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewer,system in general? ,54
2966,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,"I don't know that much about it. I do tell people that are getting hooked up, what, you know, that how ",55
2967,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,"that works, the circulation and all that. and I tell them how it works.  ",56
2978,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewer,"Did you, was that something you had to pay for? Is that or was that there when you bought the house? ",57
2968,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,"Oh, I bought the house from the original people that built it and that was how it was installed. And what ",58
2969,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,the circulation system does is it just puts it back into the main without having to leave water running in ,59
2970,April 22,Interview 32 ,212,1,Interviewee,the house. ,60
2988,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,That’s great. And just doesn't let it freeze. Right.  ,61
2979,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewee,Yeah. It filters back into the main instead of down the drain. ,62
2989,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,"Haha, cool. I like that phrase, I like that. Okay. Is that something that, I mean, can more people do that? ",63
2990,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,Is it expensive? ,64
2980,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewee,It's just another way of [inaudible] ,65
2991,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. What's your thought on, I mean, more and more people are moving from ",66
2992,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,"hauled to piped? Is that, is that a good direction to be moving? Do people like the hauled? ",67
2981,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewee,"Oh, some people like the hauled. They do. They figured they have a better handle on the water being ",68
2982,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewee,clean and tank being clean and some people prefer the hauled but it's more expensive. The bills are ,69
2983,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewee,higher. ,70
2993,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. And have you had any service delays or interruptions? ,71
2984,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewee,"Well, they let they tell. They tell us ahead of time when they're gonna shut off to fix something. ",72
2994,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,Okay. And how often does that happen?  ,73
2985,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewee,"Some summers, it's a lot. Sometimes it's not. There was something in the middle of the winter where ",74
2986,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewee,"they had to fix something, but it wasn't cold enough to freeze things.  ",75
2995,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay. So it's I mean, in general, you said happy with your water system. You like it? No major ",76
2996,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,complaints? ,77
2987,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, I can live with it. That's fine. ",78
2997,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,"Okay, well, and then the last kind of couple of questions is some people pack water out in the villages, ",79
2998,April 22,Interview 32 ,213,1,Interviewer,"and that kind of thing. And do anyone, does anyone do that I mean, in  [REDACTED], or? ",80
2999,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,"Probably because, you know, when I drive home I on the on the, I drive by the one of the city buildings ",81
3000,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,where the trucks go up and get their water. And there's a little sidestep thing where people can buy ,82
3001,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,"water, fill their own little tanks. And some of them have big tanks in their truck. And some people are ",83
3002,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,"just filling little five gallon things. Okay, so that's the water that's being hauled. ",84
3017,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewer,"Okay, got it. Got it. But it's probably more expensive. ",85
3015,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee ,"Well, no, they're just I don't know what it charges. I don't think I think they save money that way. And ",86
3016,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee ,maybe they don't have running water in their house. They’re getting it themselves and taking it away.  ,87
3018,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewer,"Okay, yeah. Okay. Do you feel, and so you have quite a few filters. Once it’s gone through all the filters ",88
3019,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewer,do you think you feel comfortable that it's safe to drink?  ,89
3003,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, or it might be time to change a filter.  ",90
3020,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Yeah. So does it ever taste, like you can taste it when you need to change it or does it ever ",91
3021,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewer,taste? ,92
3004,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,"No I, what happens is it looks like the water pressures going down, it just means its clogged up. ",93
3005,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,"Another thing that hauled water people have to deal with in the winter, is they have to be on top of the ",94
3006,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,"schedule of when their sewer is being evac-ed , okay? Because they have to put a heat tape they have ",95
3007,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,to plug it in and actually cook that. Or heat it. If you leave it plugged in your electric bill [inaudible]. But if ,96

3013,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,it rises it could break the pipe into the exhaust pipe [inaudible] Or they weigh it down with sandbags ,103
3014,April 22,Interview 32 ,214,1,Interviewee,because its not under the house. During break up those things can float. ,104

3026,April 22,Interview 32 ,215,1,Interviewee,they're gonna have to figure something else out. ,110
3041,April 22,Interview 32 ,215,1,Interviewer,Like he's gonna hook into your pipe without hooking into the main? ,111
3027,April 22,Interview 32 ,215,1,Interviewee,"Well, yeah, because that's where it's located. It would make sense. But at top of that, I have a ",112
3028,April 22,Interview 32 ,215,1,Interviewee,circulation and the heat tape system that would get compromised. They didn't ask me that they just built ,113
3029,April 22,Interview 32 ,215,1,Interviewee,"this house. Yeah, I think whoever buys the house after me if I sell it and whatever, I'll tell them that ",114
3030,April 22,Interview 32 ,215,1,Interviewee,that’s something that might come up. ,115

3032,April 22,Interview 32 ,215,1,Interviewee,septic thing that they had to hook up to my sewer pipe and have a valve put in and stuff because if that ,118

3084,April 22,Interview 33 ,218,1,Interviewee 1,Only issue we've ever had was our pipes were frozen on the outside. And so they weren't able to give ,30

3098,April 22,Interview 33 ,218,1,Interviewer,"Gotcha. Okay, what do you do in that case? ",32

3087,April 22,Interview 33 ,218,1,Interviewee 1,Yeah ,35
3107,April 22,Interview 33 ,219,1,Interviewer,Okay that’s a bigger expense  ,36

3111,April 22,Interview 33 ,219,1,Interviewer,"Gotcha. Okay, if something does break, no you're renting. So maybe that's part of this. But if something ",44
3112,April 22,Interview 33 ,219,1,Interviewer,"does break, what do you do? Are there people you can call or you just call your landlord and they figure ",45

3157,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer,Okay. All right. What about what about the like pipes and other parts of town right? So part of ,86
3158,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] is piped in part of its hauled. Is that piped system something that you would like want to ,87
3159,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer,be on? Is that seem like it's better? It seemed like it’s pretty similar? ,88
3148,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewee 1,I think it would be better. ,89
3153,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewee 2,I think it probably just goes into a one big sewage tank. Because I bet you they're all one owner ,90
3154,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewee 2,[inaudible] ,91
3168,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer ,"Oh, where the water comes from in the very beginning? Before it goes onto a truck, and before it goes ",92

3156,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewee 2,"Okay. So repeat yourself then, sorry. ",97
3162,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer,"What was I asking, oh, so, and other parts of town where it's piped. So from the treatment plant. So ",98
3163,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer,"right now you're hauled water, it comes from the treatment plant, it goes into a truck and then it goes to ",99
3164,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer,your home. The other way that could work is at the treatment plant. It goes through a pipe and then it ,100
3165,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer,goes to your home through that pipe. So all of the raised pipes that you see in like a different part of ,101
3166,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer,"town, but ",102
3149,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewee 1,"[REDACTED] I believe, we still have pipes on the outside. But we still get pumped water. I think it's just ",103
3150,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewee 1,"the buildings like the houses in like the middle of the town area, they are on piped but other than that, ",104

3167,April 22,Interview 33 ,222,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. ",106

3183,April 22,Interview 33 ,223,1,Interviewer,system? What is good about it? If there is something? ,109
3171,April 22,Interview 33 ,223,1,Interviewee 1,The only thing I kind of like is I don't have to worry about because my landlord pays for it. So it's just out ,110
3172,April 22,Interview 33 ,223,1,Interviewee 1,of our rent. So that's like the only benefit of it. ,111
3184,April 22,Interview 33 ,223,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that’s fair. And you mentioned your skin and hair, it’s not? ",112

3174,April 22,Interview 33 ,223,1,Interviewee 1,I don't even know how to get those. ,119
3180,April 22,Interview 33 ,223,1,Interviewee 2,We would have to talk to our landlord to see if we could even do it. ,120

3364,April 22,Interview 36 ,235,1,Interviewee,Yeah. [inaudible] ,45
3380,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,Good. Is it is the water affordable or is it expensive? ,46
3373,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewee,"It’s kind of, I mean, I don’t know how to answer that because my [inaudible] ",47
3381,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,"Oh great, nice, so you don’t have to worry about it. ",48
3374,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewee,It’s still kind of expensive ,49
3382,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,"Oh, okay, so it’s all in one.  ",50
3375,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewee,Mmhmm. So I guess [inaudible] ,51
3383,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,Do you have to change the filter or does your landlord come and change the filter? ,52
3376,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewee,Oh I have the Brita water filter. [inaudible] ,53
3384,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,Nice okay. How often do you change the Brita filter? ,54
3377,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewee,I change it once every month. ,55
3385,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,"Every month. Yeah, that’s fair. Yeah. If you could change something about the water system here what ",56
3386,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,would you change? ,57
3378,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewee,"Oh you know for my [REDACTED], I don’t know what they are called, it filters the whole, I don’t know ",58
3379,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewee,how much water. They are installing those into each [REDACTED]. ,59
3387,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,Oh cool. So you’d rather have that here where it's like filter in line at your own house. Okay. So it's still ,60
3388,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,like your ideal system would be piped from the plants but then it has its own treatment at your house. ,61
3389,April 22,Interview 36 ,236,1,Interviewer,So you can make sure it's all clean and whatever moves from the chlorine taste ,62
3390,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewee,Yeah [inaudible] ,63
3396,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, no that makes sense. ",64
3391,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewee,There’s no running water in  [REDACTED]. We all depend on ,65
3397,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewer,Packs and rainwater. Yeah. Do you ever run out when you're packing? ,66
3392,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewee,No with rain [inaudible] pack a lot of it a few gallons [inaudible] ,67
3398,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] ,68
3393,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewee,"Well, yeah I think [inaudible] gallon [inaudible]. A really big water tank in our the house. ",69
3399,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, the tank’s inside the house? ",70
3394,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewee,We have a tank inside the house and then we have a [inaudible] ,71
3400,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. Okay nice. Okay I think that’s all my questions. Is there anything I should ",72
3401,April 22,Interview 36 ,237,1,Interviewer,have asked you that I didn't know.  ,73

3411,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewer,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
3412,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewer,How do you get your household water? ,2
3403,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewee,Comes from the river. And then they [inaudible] chlorine [inaudible] We don’t drink that water. ,3
3413,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewer,You don’t. What are you drinking? ,4
3404,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewee,We use rainwater or ice water for drinking water. ,5
3414,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. Like your rainwater catchment off of your roof? ",6
3405,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewee,Off the roof or we get ice. ,7
3415,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewer,"Yeah, packing it. Nice. Is it a taste thing? ",8
3406,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewee,"The water we have we have a filtration system, but it doesn’t clean everything out. And you can just ",9
3407,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewee,"taste all the chemicals in the water. And so [inaudible] you know you cook or you have tea, its just ",10
3408,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewee,tastes better. So you’re just used to it. But we [inaudible] of all that chlorine. ,11
3416,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewer,Does it meet your water needs? ,12
3409,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewee,Yeah it does. But it’s just out of a bucket. ,13
3417,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewer,"So the treated water, with the chlorine taste, its out of the river, is it then hauled to your house? ",14
3410,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewee,"No, we have a water and sewer system. ",15
3418,April 22,Interview 37 ,238,2,Interviewer,So piped? ,16
3419,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewee,"Yep, piped. ",17
3428,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewer,"And is that, it tastes chlorine-y, but does it look? ",18
3420,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewee,"It’s clear, but you’re at [REDACTED] so whatever comes from upriver comes down. ",19
3429,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, all the way down. ",20
3421,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, so you can only clean so much of it. There’s no other source of running water. ",21
3430,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, and do you like the system, does it work well for you? ",22
3422,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewee,"It's been there for [REDACTED] years, it's a convenience, it's way better than what we had. We didn’t ",23
3423,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewee,have anything. ,24
3431,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewer,So before it was all either rain or packed water? ,25
3424,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewee,Rain or packed water. You get used to that. This just makes your life a lot easier. ,26
3432,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewer,"And so you use it for showering, for cleaning ",27
3425,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewee,"For showering, for washing dishes too. Use some of it for like cooking once in a while. Maybe make ",28
3426,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewee,soup or something. ,29
3433,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewer,Where you’re not worried about the taste of it. ,30
3427,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,31
3434,April 22,Interview 37 ,239,1,Interviewer,"Okay that makes sense. Do you ever run out of water, is that ever an issue? ",32
3435,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewee,We only did in [REDACTED] because there was a flooding in the system. [inaudible] the system off. ,33
3444,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewer,Oh wow. ,34
3436,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewee,I think it was almost two years or so or some places went two years without water and sewer systems. ,35
3445,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewer,Wow. ,36
3437,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewee,Cause the state came in and they were really slow. ,37
3446,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, just a matter of replacing everything. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So is the piped water, is ",38
3447,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewer,"it affordable, is it costly? ",39
3438,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewee,"I think it's $85 a month now, they knocked it down from [inaudible] over a hundred. So they knocked it ",40
3439,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewee,"down to 85. So not everybody can afford it. There's not enough jobs, not anything. That's one of the ",41
3440,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewee,increments. ,42
3448,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewer,"Okay, yeah, in terms of like [inaudible] pipes broken, flooding, are there any issues that you run into ",43
3449,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewer,with it? ,44
3441,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, you do in the wintertime, because you have to keep your heat tape on and [inaudible] ",45
3450,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewer,Okay. ,46
3442,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewee,But then the system can freeze too at the same time. They have they have heat tape that run through it ,47
3443,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewee,but there's a lot of times it freezes over. ,48
3451,April 22,Interview 37 ,240,1,Interviewer,Have you had that happen to you? ,49
3452,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,"I’ve had it, oh how many times [inaudible] someone to thaw it out or something. Our section part ",50
3453,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,[inaudible]. ,51
3465,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewer,"Okay, so do you have to call someone else to come do that? ",52
3454,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,"Yep you do. So, they have four guys that work there at the water plant. So they come over and thaw it ",53
3455,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,"out, and so they’re only responsible for the exterior [inaudible]. ",54
3466,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewer,So it doesn’t freeze interior [inaudible]? ,55
3463,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee ,"Some people have if you don't keep your, because if you leave right, and it freezes, some people ",56
3464,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee ,[inaudible] ,57
3467,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewer,"Oh, oh, and then does it flood when the water comes back on or something like that? ",58
3456,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,[inaudible] then you have to replace the whole system. ,59
3468,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. So in general what do most people do, the combination of rainwater, pack, and piped? ",60
3457,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,"Some people do and some people don't, you know not everybody used to rainwater because we have ",61
3458,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,"to filter it, we filter it through a Britta filter too. ",62
3469,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewer,"Okay, in order to drink. ",63
3459,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, in order to drink it. It’s still not completely pure because you have sediments that come off, you ",64
3460,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,know from the rain or from the [inaudible] something comes out but not everything comes out. And part ,65
3461,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,of our town doesn’t have water. ,66
3470,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewer,Okay. ,67
3462,April 22,Interview 37 ,241,1,Interviewee,[inaudible] ,68
3480,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewer,"Okay, and so they’re completely relying on the rainwater? ",69
3471,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewee,There’s rainwater and now there’s a [inaudible] system that you can come across to get water. ,70
3481,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewer,"Okay, like a washeteria or something? ",71
3472,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewee,"It’s not a washeteria, its just a hose that comes out of the water plant. ",72
3482,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewer,"Got it, okay, that makes sense. Is there anything you would change about the system as it is? ",73
3473,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewee,The [inaudible] system that they have is better than what they have in [REDACTED]? ,74
3483,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewer,Yeah. ,75
3474,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewee,"So the one that they designed for is a box, so you can open the box up, it’s insulated and [inaudible] so ",76
3475,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewee,"when sections break or they freeze, you can open up and heat that section up. ",77
3484,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. ",78
3476,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewee,So when they first came we weren't too sure if that's going to be any good. But it's been over ,79
3477,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED] years so it’s working good. So, when you have certain areas, you don’t have to change ",80
3478,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewee,"the whole system, you can change it right there. So that was a good design. ",81
3485,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewer,"Great, is it more expensive that way? Do you know why they haven’t done it here? ",82
3479,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewee,[REDACTED]  ,83
3486,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, and I’m sure COVID and all that kind of thing hasn’t helped it. Well that’s all, is there anything I ",84
3487,April 22,Interview 37 ,242,1,Interviewer,should have asked you or anything I should know that we haven’t talked about? ,85
3488,April 22,Interview 37 ,243,1,Interviewee,"Oh, the only thing we would see that you know, like ours we still use a bucket, but if we had a better ",86
3489,April 22,Interview 37 ,243,1,Interviewee,"system that we could use, because people still use that so you have to use a [inaudible] Sometimes it’d ",87
3490,April 22,Interview 37 ,243,1,Interviewee,be unsanitary [inaudible] if they designed a small system that you can use or people can use that are ,88
3491,April 22,Interview 37 ,243,1,Interviewee,more safe than to ,89
3495,April 22,Interview 37 ,243,1,Interviewer,Like a system that would catch the rain water that would then keep it enclosed. ,90
3492,April 22,Interview 37 ,243,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, like before we used to have a tank inside the house [inaudible] fill up with rainwater [inaudible] I ",91
3493,April 22,Interview 37 ,243,1,Interviewee,"wonder if we could figure out how we can make it more, somebody would have to design something ",92
3494,April 22,Interview 37 ,243,1,Interviewee,that’s more sanitary. ,93
3496,April 22,Interview 37 ,243,1,Interviewer,"Than a bucket, no yeah that makes sense. Great, thank you.  ",94
3503,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewer,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
3504,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewer,Oh wonderful. So how do you get your water?  ,2
3497,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewee,Through the water plant. ,3
3505,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewer,And you have – is it piped or do you have someone deliver it? ,4
3498,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewee,"It goes – no, it’s piped. It’s through the sewer system. Water sewer system. ",5
3506,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewer,"Cool. Okay, cool. How do you like that? Does it work well for you? ",6
3499,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewee,Yeah. The water come in. It's better than having to pack it. ,7
3507,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewer,Absolutely. Have you always had piped water? ,8
3500,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewee,In my life? No. ,9
3508,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewer,"Okay. When you were young, did you pack water? ",10
3501,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewee,"Yeah, from the river we have to even go by boat to go to clear water. ",11
3509,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewer,Do you ever miss doing that? Are you kind of really happy that you don't have that chore anymore? ,12
3502,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewee,I think I'm more happy that we don't have the chore. ,13
3510,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. Um, who taught you about water when you were young? When you were packing water, ",14
3511,April 22,Interview 38 ,244,2,Interviewer,was that with your whole family with your parents? Or? ,15
3512,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,"Basically, everybody in the village. We all did it. The only people that didn't have to pack the water were ",16
3513,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,teachers. Teachers and the principal. ,17
3523,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewer,Okay. Cool. Do you ever have any issues with your water now? Do you like the way it was? ,18
3514,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,"In [REDACTED] there is because saltwater comes in.  [REDACTED]. And so the tide comes up, ",19
3515,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,"saltwater comes in, especially if it's a certain wind. And so that saltwater gets into our tank if there's not ",20
3516,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,enough water in there. And then comes to our faucet which if we don't have an osmosis filter and so ,21
3517,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,everybody started getting osmosis filters. ,22
3524,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewer,And that makes it taste good?  ,23
3518,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,Yeah. Yeah. So if you don't have one you're drinking saltwater. The [REDACTED] didn't have one ,24
3519,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,"either. Until we bugged them, but we only have so much if we could. ",25
3525,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewer,You use that filtered water for everything you do or is that for the drinking? ,26
3520,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,Just drinking  ,27
3526,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewer,Okay and everything other stuff that you do with water?  ,28
3521,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,Yeah. Washing and it doesn't matter what’s in it as long as it’s water. Clean water. ,29
3527,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewer,Do you always have water in different seasons? Are there ever any challenges with you know any ,30
3528,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewer,issues with the pipe? ,31
3522,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewee,"Only during the winter, it freezes. Then we don't have water. ",32
3529,April 22,Interview 38 ,245,1,Interviewer,Yeah. What do you do when it freezes? ,33
3530,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,"We – [REDACTED]. So just have to call the maintenance and say, ‘something's going on’. Yeah, yeah. ",34
3531,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,So you've been out of water for at least three times this year. One of them was due to the [inaudible; ,35
3532,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,likely “sub”] there was a problem with the freezing the sub so they had to turn off all the water for us to ,36
3533,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,get the sub running. But the other ones were freezing water pipes. ,37
3544,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewer,"And so your water is part of [REDACTED] housing. So, affordability-wise, is that just all included? You ",38
3545,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewer,don't pay separately for that or do you pay for that? ,39
3534,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,"It's people direct. Yeah, but it's probably our rent is so much cheaper than anywhere else. But it's ",40
3535,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,included in everything. So is electricity. ,41
3546,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewer,Okay. I had my next question and then I lost it. ,42
3536,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,Were you gonna ask about the community?  ,43
3547,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, thank you. Yeah, so others in the community, how did they get there water? ",44
3537,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,Same way. They they're all piped. There is one house that's not piped. And they have to go to their ,45
3538,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,"relatives to water. A lot of them aren’t having aren’t getting their water for some reason, they go over to ",46
3539,April 22,Interview 38 ,246,1,Interviewee,the laundromat to get their water and especially if they want the osmosis water. They just recently had ,47

3565,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewee,would be best. ,4
3573,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewer,"So you, so you have a pump. So, do you go to the pump? And like get the water and then bring it ",5
3574,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewer,home? Or? ,6
3566,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewee,"No, we there's water service for everyone in [REDACTED], and but people that are like living on the, ",7

3568,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewee,"Actually, it depends on if people are like living across the river they take will get the water themselves. ",10
3576,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewer,Okay. And so you said you'd prefer to drink other water? ,11
3569,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewee,Boiled water or rainwater. ,12
3577,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewer,So you boil the water that that you have in your home? That that water from the pump? Do you boil it ,13
3578,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewer,before you drink it? ,14
3570,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewee,"If sometimes yeah, but there's once in a great while it'll be like brown or yellow. Okay, so that's how ",15
3571,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewee,come I always liked to uh boil it.  ,16
3579,April 22,Interview 39 ,248,2,Interviewer,Do you like the taste of it then when? Either before or after it’s boiled? ,17
3580,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewee,"Before or after, it depends on the taste. But there are some times you got to boil it because it'll taste ",18
3581,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewee,how to say kind of gross like. ,19
3590,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewer,Is it gross like dirty or gross like chemically? ,20

3583,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewee,"We can collect them, but yeah, but we gotta wait for rainy seasons. ",23
3592,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, so when it's not the rainy reason you really can't get enough to store? ",24
3584,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewee,But the water is nice and good when it's wintertime though. It's it's like how to say we're cold and fresh ,25
3585,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewee,"like, probably because the ice is like blocked off from the materials like from the mud. Probably what ",26
3586,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewee,"the water intake takes from our village, it's probably taken from the bottom close to the mud I guess. ",27
3593,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewer,Yeah. That's interesting. That's really good to know. If you do have rainwater when it is the rainy ,28
3594,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewer,"season and you collect that water, do you drink it straight from when you collect it? ",29
3587,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewee,"Yeah, yeah, rainwater is best. Yeah, it tastes for us. Tastes clean. ",30

3589,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewee,"water more, I guess. Maybe ",34
3597,April 22,Interview 39 ,249,1,Interviewer,"And you say when it's getting better, the natural water or the water from the plant? ",35
3598,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewee,The plant. It started to taste better. But there's some times that we gotta wait for him to repair the pipes ,36
3599,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewee,though sometimes. ,37
3610,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewer,"So, do you have times where something broke there so you don't get water? ",38

3613,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewer,"And when that happens, things go wrong? ",45
3604,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewee,"Sometimes, but most part is they just gotta wait, or watch what when when the pipes freeze. That's a ",46
3605,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewee,big problem. Cuz sometimes the pipes do freeze at home. ,47
3614,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewer,What do you do when the pipes freeze? ,48
3606,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewee,"We either get iced water or if not, we'd collect water from the powerplant. Now power plant, but water ",49
3607,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewee,plant. ,50
3615,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewer,When you get the ice water bring it in and boil it or melt it down and then? ,51
3608,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewee,No ice water is all good we can just drink it how it is cuz ice water it usually melts from ice as we ,52
3609,April 22,Interview 39 ,250,1,Interviewee,pickaxe and get ice. ,53
3628,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewer,Okay and then you just leave it and it’ll melt and you can drink it. ,54
3616,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,yeah ,55
3629,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewer,And so for things that you're not drinking so for like washing and cleaning use the same water is the ,56
3630,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewer,water that comes from the plant or the rain? ,57
3617,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,Yeah from the pipe or from the water plant we usually use but our village hasn't had any major accident ,58
3618,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,or anything any major disasters since last time. ,59
3631,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] ,60

3621,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,good. ,63
3632,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewer,The water that you get from the plant is that affordable do you have to pay for that?  ,64
3622,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,"No, it's free. ",65
3633,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewer,"Oh, it's free. Good. Okay anything you would change about your water? ",66
3623,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,I'd have to say the part plant might need to be remodeled maybe. ,67
3634,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewer,"Mm, why is that? ",68
3624,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,"Not like remodeled but more like cleaned as I should say cuz I saw, how to say it, how to say it, Oh I ",69
3625,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,"meant to say more organized like with their stuff, their equipment and stuff. Not all over not really ",70
3626,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,"literally all over but just need some more, how to say it, just to be ordered like orderly like know where ",71
3627,April 22,Interview 39 ,251,1,Interviewee,the things are and but there's times our water plant needs more parts for people's housings. ,72
3641,April 22,Interview 39 ,252,1,Interviewer,So at people's houses sometimes their stuff breaks or they don't have or they need someone to come ,73
3642,April 22,Interview 39 ,252,1,Interviewer,fix it. ,74
3635,April 22,Interview 39 ,252,1,Interviewee,Yeah. But the parts for from being shipped from city to the villages it's quite spendy. ,75

3636,April 22,Interview 39 ,252,1,Interviewee,Usually when something breaks in the house with like if a water pipe break we'd call up the water man. ,78
3637,April 22,Interview 39 ,252,1,Interviewee,For now in our village we got about four or five maybe workers for the water plant. We pretty much trust ,79
3638,April 22,Interview 39 ,252,1,Interviewee,him though. We trust what they're doing. They try to keep our water clean. ,80
3645,April 22,Interview 39 ,252,1,Interviewer,"That's good. Well, I don't think that I have any more questions for you. But is there anything else about ",81
3646,April 22,Interview 39 ,252,1,Interviewer,water that you want to tell me that I didn't ask? Anything I should have asked you? ,82

3690,April 22,Interview 4 ,21,1,Interviewee,"And the wind, a lot of rain. But then could we think of an idea and took rainwater in a cup.  ",58

3782,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"Well, yeah, water issues here. [REDACTED] deals with that. And, like, yeah, sometimes it's yellow ",26
3783,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"coming out of the sink in the kitchen. But then you just run it for a while and it's fine. And I mean, my ",27
3784,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"water is yellow at home always. So like, it doesn't I think that I am a little bit less anxious about water ",28
3785,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"things than many of my friends. I'll put it that way. But also because like why you can't fix it. Like, I can't ",29
3786,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"fix it. And so I feel like being anxious about it is a little bit of a wasted emotion, which is funny because ",30
3787,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"I'm anxious about everything else. Everything else, but it's like, it's the one thing like the one thing I'm ",31
3788,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"like, meh I don’t know, whatever. It’s probably not gonna kill me right now. But yeah.  ",32
3803,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewer,Do you have any sense of why your friends are anxious about it? ,33
3789,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"No. They, I mean, my one friend that I'm thinking of is just extremely picky about how her water tastes. ",34
3790,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"And I'm like, if it's no and I will say I am like that. If it has like a kind of that moldy musty taste, I'm like, ",35
3791,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"this is an absolute no go for me. Which is funny because that tastes to me happens more often in like, ",36
3792,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"you know, you put the jug on the water stand because people don't clean this the spigots. And so, like ",37
3793,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"we have one of those that goes in the meeting rooms and I took it apart not too long ago, just like ",38
3794,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"cleaned it because it was like this tastes funky. Cleaned it as much as I could put it all you know, ",39
3795,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"flushed it with hot soapy water flushed it with vinegar. I was like, you know, just doing thing, put it back ",40
3796,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"together. Of course that little taste is still there, because you can never fully clean that kind of stuff. But ",41
3797,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewee ,"to me, that's really the only thing that I will be like, I will not drink this water, if it tastes like mold.  ",42
3804,April 22,Interview 40 ,254,1,Interviewer,Probably a good standard. ,43
3805,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,"But I grew up drinking tap water in [REDACTED], and it used to be the, like, best water that anybody ",44
3806,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,"had ever tasted. And then in within the last, like, [REDACTED] years or so, I mean, definitely after I left ",45
3807,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,"the house, but I would go back to my parents house, and they started chlorinating it and you could still- ",46
3815,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewer,Taste it. ,47
3808,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,"Yeah. So like, I when I grew up, we would just drink out of the tap. Like, period. And now, I, that is its ",48
3809,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,"foul. So but a Brita takes it out, and I use a Brita at home here ",49
3816,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewer,Does it take out the yellow color at home? ,50
3810,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,Some of it. Not all of it. ,51
3817,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewer,"Not, is it not super worrying though? ",52
3811,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,"What am I gonna do? I mean, I'm not gonna buy water. That feels.  ",53
3818,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewer,Are you piped at home?  ,54
3812,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,"Um, it's, uh, well, so my apartment building has its own well. ",55
3819,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewer,Is it so it’s a private well? ,56
3813,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,I think so. There are not that many in town. ,57
3820,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewer,Right. [REDACTED] ,58
3814,April 22,Interview 40 ,255,1,Interviewee ,"Okay, well I am one of them. ",59

3822,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"My water is like, this color. No, it's a little brown. It's like in between that and this. No, it's not actually ",61
3823,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"that. Well, I mean, this shower, the shower is like that. I mean, that's thing. I don't know if people have ",62
3824,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"talked about like, their showers being super rusty. But um, I. Yeah, I mean, it's bad. Like, it is not pretty. ",63
3825,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"I was looking at it the other day, and I thought, God, I haven't cleaned this in a while because it's like, ",64
3826,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"why, why bother? But it's super gross. So yeah, like my my Brita filter that you know, basket inside of it. ",65
3827,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"That I replace the filter every month. I like scrub and scrub on that basket thing, but it doesn't really ",66
3828,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"come off because it's just, it's on the plastic. And I think there's a little part of me that's like, yeah, does ",67
3829,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,this look gross? Yes. What else am I going to do? I am not tying myself to purchasing water. Like my ,68
3830,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"friend does that she'll be like, Oh, we ran out of water. It’s like, yeah, your sink water is right here. And ",69
3831,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"she's like, well, there’s fecal matter in the sink water. And I'm like, Oh, it’s probably not gonna kill you. ",70
3832,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"So yeah, [REDACTED], so yeah.  ",71
3842,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewer,"So do you pay for water at your apartment? Or is that like, included in your rent? ",72
3833,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"It's included in the rent. Which and that's a reason. The apartment is not the best place I've ever lived, ",73
3834,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"but that is honestly, that's a massive reason why I moved. Because, like, I have had living situations ",74
3835,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"that are like, Hey, if you want to live here, it's this much and you know, you can have a dog and you can ",75
3836,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"like have your own little house and like, all this stuff, but water costs always push that that rent, you ",76
3837,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"know, full rent up, and it's like, I mean, a place that is equivalent, like seems like it's equivalent. Rent ",77
3838,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,"wise, you're talking $400, $300 - $400 a month more just in water. And so it's like, okay, every month ",78
3839,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,so I can't really justify that.  ,79
3843,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] ,80
3844,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewer,Was that going to be hauled water?  ,81

3845,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. Piped water is more affordable, though than hauled. ",83
3846,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewer,"Like hauled is most expensive, then piped, and then included with your rent is.  ",84
3841,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewee ,Yeah.  ,85
3847,April 22,Interview 40 ,256,1,Interviewer,Man. Yeah. That’s tough Does that well ever run out? Do they constrain it? Is it basically limitless?  ,86
3848,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"I mean, I think it's limitless. ",87
3871,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewer,"Have you had any, like seasonal issues? Like does it freeze up? ",88
3849,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"Not usually there was, it's, you know, I'm like, man, it's been a while because there was a time, couple ",89
3850,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"years ago, when the water stopped, I think it was in the winter. So that might have been a freeze up ",90
3851,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"thing or something thing. And I just, what did I do? I think I just borrowed like, an old ",91

3857,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"nevermind, doesn't work. But yeah know that, that water is consistent. When the power goes out, and I ",97
3858,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"don't know about this, but in my mind, I'm like, Well, if the power goes out, then there's gotta be ",98
3859,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"something like there's water in the pipes. So that'll come out. But then it's not gonna like that motor, ",99
3860,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"sucking it up at some point isn't gonna keep going. So when the power goes out, what I do is I one of ",100

3862,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,that long. But I always feel like it's one of those things where the power is gonna go out and then I'm ,102
3863,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"gonna be like, I'm so thirsty. I have nothing to drink. But yeah, so that's, that's really the only time I think ",103

3865,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"I mean, the this stuff in it is like rough on my hair. I think it's mostly has to do with like, the quality of ",107
3866,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"what comes out of the tap. It’s like extremely mineral and very, you know, it's so all of the things that ",108
3867,April 22,Interview 40 ,257,1,Interviewee ,"are because that's really the only thing that's like wrong with it. I mean, you cannot drink it out of the ",109

3878,April 22,Interview 40 ,258,1,Interviewee ,"water. Maybe even worse than where I'm at now, which is hard to beat. But there, when you turn to the ",118
3879,April 22,Interview 40 ,258,1,Interviewee ,"shower on the whole bathroom would just smell like hot blood, which like, that's gross. But also, you get ",119

3891,April 22,Interview 40 ,258,1,Interviewee ,I think a lot of people don't trust the water that comes from the city. Because sometimes we get the ,135

3898,April 22,Interview 40 ,258,1,Interviewee ,their homes is part of people's lives in [REDACTED] in a way that it isn't down in states. I think for the ,142

3900,April 22,Interview 40 ,258,1,Interviewee ,"you know, it's that idea of having to manage that service is everywhere. I mean, it kind of feels to me ",144
3901,April 22,Interview 40 ,258,1,Interviewee ,"like you would, it feels like something where you would have to hit a button on your router anytime you ",145
3902,April 22,Interview 40 ,258,1,Interviewee ,"wanted the Internet to work. Yeah, we're like, it's not hard. But it is something that you have to pay ",146
3903,April 22,Interview 40 ,258,1,Interviewee ,attention to. And you can't just kind of set it and forget it the same way that you do with other things or ,147
3904,April 22,Interview 40 ,258,1,Interviewee ,that you can with water down states.  ,148
3930,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah, that's interesting. Do you so for your friends that are on piped or ",149

3910,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"I don't know. I mean, everybody always has problems with their pumps. And they're, you know, that's ",152
3911,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"the idea of like, house sitting in [REDACTED] is huge. I mean, that's the thing is you don't even call it ",153
3912,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"there's dog sitting which is one thing, but for people without animals if you're gonna go anywhere in the ",154

3933,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewer,I’ve been wondering that because peopled have said things about going away for stretches of time. It ,156
3934,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewer,sounds like it’s pretty common to go away for a little while. But no one has talked about what who ,157
3935,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewer,watches their house. ,158
3914,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,That’s very interesting. So there is a there is a kind of I think it seems pretty large when I think about ,159
3915,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,the people I know who do this. Kind of almost not like underground but like there's a large network of ,160
3916,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,people who house sit consistently. And it is a lot of times I mean in the summer you can go away and ,161
3917,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"you know it's normally fine, but it's less for like theft prevention. And at least in the winter, it is keeping ",162
3918,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"the water going, you know, making sure the house nothing goes wrong with the heater or anything like ",163
3919,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"that because then you your pipes burst, So that's kind of a that's a thing. And people pay money. And ",164
3920,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,not small amount of money. And so and many people also have animals. So then it kind of doubles ,165
3921,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"where it's like, do you want to dog sit?  ",166
3936,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewer,Also make sure my house keeps working.  ,167
3922,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"Right. And there's so part of that is like, sure I’ll dog sit but it's not like I'm gonna come in and feed your ",168
3923,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"dog twice a day. It's like, no, I'm gonna come live in your house for a week because using the house in ",169
3924,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"the winter is absolutely required to make sure things keep working. So yeah, I mean, there's a lot of ",170
3925,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,people I know that do that. That are kind of and that kind of fits in also with that kind of younger adult ,171
3926,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"idea of like, I have three roommates. But like, are we ever really all home at the same time? You know, ",172
3927,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"like, if you have a smaller house and like less personal space, but you're spending a week over here, ",173
3928,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"and then you're back for you know, two weeks? And then somebody else's spending week over here? It ",174
3929,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewee ,"works well, I think. ",175
3937,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] ,176
3938,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewer,"I have a question on that again, I don't know if you can answer. But it's something that come up a few ",177
3939,April 22,Interview 40 ,259,1,Interviewer,times that you just you might know. One thing that we've heard from a handful of people is we've asked ,178
3960,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewer,"them the question of like, so if something breaks, what do you do? And also, who do you call, right? So ",179
3961,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewer,"we understand that, like, there is a little bit of a lack of, you know, plumbers and such in [REDACTED], ",180
3962,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewer,but we've also noticed that a lot of people don't say I call my neighbor. And that's been surprising for ,181
3963,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewer,us. And I don't know if maybe that's just happens to be the people we've spoken to have said ,182
3964,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewer,"something different. But I just think in a lot of my experiences, even when I haven't really known my ",183
3965,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewer,"neighbors, they're still the first person I go to if something breaks in the house, because they're just ",184
3966,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewer,"right there. Yeah. Anyway, I don't know. I wasn't sure if you might have a sense of that. ",185
3940,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewee ,"Well, I think it depends on like, what breaks. I like because there's kind of for me if it's something that I ",186
3941,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewee ,can either handle or work around it being broken. Sometimes I call my landlord. Sometimes not ,187
3942,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewee ,"honestly. Because then when it's something I can't handle, it's like call the landlord Right? ",188
3967,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewer,Right. Don’t want to be the [REDACTED] who cried wolf? ,189
3943,April 22,Interview 40 ,260,1,Interviewee ,"Right? Yeah, instead I'm the like, weird [REDACTED] who like never called landlord for anything. ",190

4008,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewer,Who do you call? Yeah. And why don’t people call their neighbors. ,227
3988,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"I mean, well, cuz  ",228
4009,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewer,Or do they? Yeah. ,229
3989,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"They may if their neighbor knows anything about plumbing. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people rent in this ",230
3990,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"town, and so it's like, your first call is your landlord, because you don't want to pay for it. And there’s ",231
3991,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"always somebody, there's always somebody asking, like, my something happened with my pipes or ",232
3992,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"something like on Facebook, like in the [REDACTED] groups. And then they’ll be like, ah, like, who to ",233

3994,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"numbers and put people's names, and so I think a lot of it is the renting thing. I think a lot of it is also ",235
3995,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"that the problems that happen, are not usually fixes that normal people should do. They probably do do ",236
3996,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"them, but in my mind, I think you have this is like a more major thing than I'm going to want somebody ",237
3997,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,who knows a little bit more about it. ,238
4010,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's a good question. Well, I think that's most of is there anything that we didn't ask that you ",239
4011,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewer,"think we should know or understand about water in general in the community? And I like, like, this ",240
4012,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewer,"institutional corridor thing? Is that working out? Are you liking it, I mean, I guess doesn't really change ",241
4013,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewer,things for you. But do people you talk to like it? ,242
3998,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,The what?  ,243
4014,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] ,244
4015,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewer,Was it like a good thing or a bad thing for you? ,245
3999,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"Oh, God, I would love piped water because then it wouldn't be brown. And when I, when that project ",246
4000,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"started happening, or like started being talked about happening, I was like, there is no way in hell, I'm ",247
4001,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"still going to be at this apartment in you know, X number of years when it's well, now I’m like, oh God ",248
4002,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"probably still gonna be here. But yeah, I mean, I would love when I go to people's like, when you go to ",249
4003,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"people's homes in this town, it's hard because everybody basically everybody used to be on hauled ",250
4004,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"water except for [REDACTED]. But there's always that thing where you have to think like, is this person ",251
4005,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"on hauled water or is this person on piped water? Because if you waste somebody's water, who’s he's ",252
4006,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"on delivered water. You’re, I mean, you're like, sending their money down the drain. Or you know, ",253
4007,April 22,Interview 40 ,262,1,Interviewee ,"before you wash your hands, or, you know, like, you know, if you like wet your hands and turn the water ",254
4016,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewee ,"off like. And so I've been, even though I've never had hauled water, a lot of my friends do and so I try to ",255
4017,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewee ,"be really cognizant of that of like not wasting it. But when I'm at my house, I definitely use more water ",256
4018,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewee ,"than when I'm not at my house. And I think, yeah, it would be great if everybody could have piped ",257
4019,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewee ,"water. I mean, it's, it takes away so much of the difficulty of accessing the service and the costs. And ",258
4020,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewee ,"like, I don't even know, how much does piped cost do they charge it by the? ",259
4023,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewer,"So piped is not metered, and so they have unlimited. They can use as much as they want, and they just ",260
4024,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewer,"pay a flat fee each month. I think I've heard some mixed messages on how much that fee is, so I'm not ",261
4025,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewer,sure if- $300 is the range and somewhere around there. But then like $800 is what people pay for ,262
4026,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewer,hauled water for like 1000 gallons once a week. ,263
4021,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewee ,It's incredibly expensive ,264
4027,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewer,"It is really expensive. Yeah, that's rough. Okay, well, is there anything else you should have asked you?  ",265
4022,April 22,Interview 40 ,263,1,Interviewee ,I don't think so.  ,266
4028,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,2,Interviewer ,So maybe we can start with if you grew up. Having grown up in [REDACTED] were you on piped or ,1
4029,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,2,Interviewer ,hauled water? ,2
4030,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,3,Interviewee ,"Um, I was. ",3
4031,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,4,Interviewer ,"Or, or neither? ",4
4032,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,5,Interviewee ,All. I remember my appa dumping honey buckets in the community. Dump those big green things that ,5
4033,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,5,Interviewee ,are around town. That you see with the tip up things?  ,6
4034,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,6,Interviewer ,Yes. Yeah.  ,7
4035,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,7,Interviewee ,I remember my grandpa dumping honey buckets in there.  ,8
4036,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,8,Interviewer ,Wow. Okay.  ,9
4037,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,9,Interviewee ,And I remember when the pipes lit were literally hauled into town. And we used to play on those pipes  ,10
4038,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,10,Interviewer ,Walking and balancing on them.  ,11
4039,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,11,Interviewee ,We used to climb and climb up on them like jungle gyms. Play with the caps like they were plates and ,12
4040,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,11,Interviewee ,stuff. Mud pies and whatever.  ,13
4041,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,12,Interviewer ,"So, you go from honey bucket and was it rainwater catchment, initially? What were you using initially? ",14
4042,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,13,Interviewee ,Yes.  ,15
4043,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,14,Interviewer ,Rainwater?  ,16
4044,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,15,Interviewee ,"Yes. My, my grandma had a gutter that literally had a string hanging down from it. And then at the end ",17
4045,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,15,Interviewee ,was a nail to catch all the water. And then this big trash can that was covered with the flat sheet. And ,18
4046,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,15,Interviewee ,"then you know, so it will filter out the whole dirt and whatever. And then we would literally pitch all the ",19
4047,April 22,Interview 41 ,264,15,Interviewee ,water that way for drinking water. ,20
4048,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,1,Interviewer ,"Well, that's okay. That's did you have you had did you get enough that way? That what you need. ",21
4049,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,2,Interviewee ,So so sometimes you'd have to boil up the whatever water was coming out. I remember the pipes been ,22
4050,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,2,Interviewee ,installed. They were laying on the ground before they put them up on the stilts. ,23
4051,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,3,Interviewer ,Nice. That's nice. [REDACTED] Yeah. And so then were you on you said then you were on a mix of ,24
4052,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,3,Interviewer ,piped and hauled after they installed the piping. So you were still were you still catching rainwater? And ,25
4053,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,3,Interviewer ,using piped? ,26
4054,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,4,Interviewee ,"Yeah, I used a lot of Brita filters before in my life. We bought a lot of bottled water. ",27
4055,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,5,Interviewer ,Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. What was your perspective on the pipe system? Was it a good a good ,28
4056,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,5,Interviewer ,addition? Or tell me more about kind of the pipe system in general. ,29
4057,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,6,Interviewee ,The pipes in general sometimes it would be like really dirty water that would look like it was almost ,30
4058,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,6,Interviewee ,"blackish. The tubs like after we clean our kids take a bath whatever, there’d be such a really bad ring ",31
4059,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,6,Interviewee ,around the tub that would have to use shower power to clean it. Just to make our tub look white again. ,32
4060,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,6,Interviewee ,And I hated doing that because I knew that chemicals were so bad. And right now it's almost $300 a ,33
4061,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,6,Interviewee ,month just for piped water. ,34
4062,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,7,Interviewer ,"Yes. Yeah. Which that's so piped water and then hauled water is even more than that, right? Is that? ",35
4063,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,8,Interviewee ,"Yeah, hauled water is getting ",36
4064,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,9,Interviewer ,"If you’re getting like 1000 gallons every week or something, it’s like – ",37
4065,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,10,Interviewee ,Yeah. Especially if you live out in [inaudible]. That's why. ,38
4066,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,11,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yes. Yeah. That's so do you think moving to the pipes was it? I mean, the water quality, the ",39
4067,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,11,Interviewer ,"provision, the abundance of water was it was a good thing or was it? What, what's your opinion on the ",40
4068,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,11,Interviewer ,piped system? ,41
4069,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,12,Interviewee ,"Well, the hauled water seems like it's a lot more cleaner than the pipe water because it's a lot more ",42
4070,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,12,Interviewee ,rusty sometimes it's most bleachy. There's some days that they will shut completely shut off the water ,43
4071,April 22,Interview 41 ,265,12,Interviewee ,for hours and hours. [REDACTED]  ,44
4072,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,2,Interviewer ,"Oh, my goodness.  ",45
4073,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,3,Interviewee ,Yeah. So ,46
4074,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,4,Interviewer ,Because of the water quality? ,47
4075,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,5,Interviewee ,Because they were cleaning out the system or something. ,48
4076,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,6,Interviewer ,"Okay, okay. Oh, interesting. So the whole system is something it sounds like if you're picking if you if ",49
4077,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,6,Interviewer ,"you have to pick between piped and hauled, you’d prefer the hauled system? ",50
4078,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,7,Interviewee ,Yeah.  ,51
4079,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,8,Interviewer ,Okay. Yeah. Did you ever have issues in the service delivery? Did they ever not come? Or did you ever ,52
4080,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,8,Interviewer ,have issues with delivery timing? ,53
4081,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,9,Interviewee ,"Yeah, because of the snow blizzards and whatnot. Yeah, road conditions out there, sometimes they get ",54
4082,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,9,Interviewee ,pretty bad. ,55
4083,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,10,Interviewer ,"Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine we're only there in April, and it was mean I can see that it could be ",56
4084,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,10,Interviewer ,quite intense and in the midst of winter. ,57
4085,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,11,Interviewee ,"Yeah, we started blizzards in the 80s. We used to have like, literally, snow piles up above our roof, and ",58
4086,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,11,Interviewee ,"we used to climb on the roofs and slide down. And we used to dig tunnels like massive tunnels, and we ",59
4087,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,11,Interviewee ,"would never have to worry about you know, it being collapsing and whatnot. ",60
4088,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,12,Interviewer ,"Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, that's awesome. ",61
4089,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,13,Interviewee ,That's all. But it was fun growing up. ,62
4090,April 22,Interview 41 ,266,14,Interviewer ,"Yeah, that's Did you did you connect in with your neighbors and that kind of thing? The tunnels?  ",63
4091,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,1,Interviewee ,Yeah.  ,64
4092,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,2,Interviewer ,That's awesome. ,65
4093,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,3,Interviewee ,"Yeah, so and one time, we had a red tag on every one of our houses. It was I want to say it was in the ",66
4094,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,3,Interviewee ,90s. We were not allowed to use our water because we had so many different chemicals that were ,67
4095,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,3,Interviewee ,crossed off. And I'm sure you could probably find it within the city of [REDACTED].  ,68
4096,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,4,Interviewer ,"Okay, in the news? ",69
4097,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,5,Interviewee ,Yeah. And our washers were so stained with rust that we could never get closed completely cleaned. ,70
4098,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,5,Interviewee ,[REDACTED]. Never wear white out there. Never have white clothes. We kind of clean. Yeah. ,71
4099,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,6,Interviewer ,Did you do anything to filter the water that came through the hauled system or the piped system? ,72
4100,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,7,Interviewee ,"Yeah, we had we had we'd have to put something in our house and it was like a salt thing. A salt ",73
4101,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,7,Interviewee ,purification thing. It was expensive. Not a lot of people could afford stuff like that. ,74
4102,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,8,Interviewer ,Okay. That's and you said you'd use a Britta did so you never did you ever drink the water straight as ,75
4103,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,8,Interviewer ,"it's delivered, or it always went through a couple of filtration systems? ",76
4104,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,9,Interviewee ,Always filter it. But there's some people that can afford to do it. Some people had to just mix it up with ,77
4105,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,9,Interviewee ,Kool Aid and stuff. So you don't have to taste it. I wouldn't even cook with that water. ,78
4106,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,10,Interviewer ,You wouldn't. Okay. You filtered the water you cooked with too? ,79
4107,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,11,Interviewee ,Yes.  ,80
4108,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,12,Interviewer ,Okay. So did you have water hauled and piped at the same time? Did you have both systems at the ,81
4109,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,12,Interviewer ,same time? ,82
4110,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,13,Interviewee ,No.  ,83
4111,April 22,Interview 41 ,267,14,Interviewer ,Okay. Okay. ,84
4112,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,1,Interviewee ,"Because, because in certain parts of the town, you just don't have type water. It just depends on where ",85
4113,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,1,Interviewee ,you live. ,86
4114,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,2,Interviewer ,"Yes. Yeah. So did you said you were on all types of systems. Did you move around? So initially, you ",87
4115,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,2,Interviewer ,were collecting rainwater and then you maybe move to somewhere that had hauled and then maybe ,88
4116,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,2,Interviewer ,moved to somewhere that had piped. Is that how you got all three? ,89
4117,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,3,Interviewee ,Yeah. Where I put the rainwater was my appa and grandma’s house. Appa’s grandpa. And we all kind ,90
4118,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,3,Interviewee ,"of just lived together until I kind of grew up and then we when I got older, we lived at [REDACTED]. ",91
4119,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,3,Interviewee ,Sometimes it’d go without days for water. It all depends. You just always had to make sure that you ,92
4120,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,3,Interviewee ,were stocked up. And yeah. Always had to have a backup. ,93
4121,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,4,Interviewer ,"Yes, yeah. Did you keep like five gallons kind of on hand? Or how did you? ",94
4122,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,5,Interviewee ,Oh about 20 gallons on hand. Just in case. ,95
4123,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,6,Interviewer ,"Yeah. And then did you do any? Did your system ever break? I mean, did it ever frozen pipes or leaks ",96
4124,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,6,Interviewer ,or that kind of thing? ,97
4125,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,7,Interviewee ,"No, because we were really kept on it. And we always had heat tape on. Even the oil. Yeah, you’d have ",98
4126,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,7,Interviewee ,to put heat tape on it. ,99
4127,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,8,Interviewer ,"Wow. Okay. Yeah. So that's so you had a regular kind of, did you do that every month did -  you kind of ",100
4128,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,8,Interviewer ,like checked out the system frequently it sounds like. ,101
4129,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,9,Interviewee ,Every year once a year check up. Just like a car. ,102
4130,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,10,Interviewer ,Yeah. Keep it running. Yes. Yeah. That makes sense. ,103
4131,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,11,Interviewee ,Definitely. ,104
4132,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,12,Interviewer ,"Okay. Okay. That's it. So it's, it sounds like there's a lot of things that kind of could be improved in terms ",105
4133,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,12,Interviewer ,"of the water quality side of things is there? What do you like about the system? Maybe, I mean, let's ",106
4134,April 22,Interview 41 ,268,12,Interviewer ,talk maybe pipe system. What did you like about the pipe system? ,107
4135,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,1,Interviewee ,"Well, you always, you always had running water besides when they cleaned. You just had to make sure ",108
4136,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,1,Interviewee ,"that your water was running during cold, cold spells. Just you have to a lot of maintenance with your ",109
4137,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,1,Interviewee ,"boilers, everything. And I didn't have to haul my laundry to any facility. And that was a major thing for a ",110
4138,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,1,Interviewee ,lot of people. ,111
4139,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,2,Interviewer ,"Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. And what kind of things did you like on the home ",112
4140,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,2,Interviewer ,side? You'd said that it had better water quality? ,113
4141,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,3,Interviewee ,"Yeah. Yeah, you could. Basically you could almost drink out of the tap. And it tasted better ",114
4142,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,4,Interviewer ,Wow. That's a pretty substantial difference. ,115
4143,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,5,Interviewee ,Wow. But you never know. So you still should always clean your water. ,116
4144,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,6,Interviewer ,"Yeah. Okay. Yep, that makes sense. That makes sense. I don't know if you're in tight on time, we kind ",117
4145,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,6,Interviewer ,of changed our structure of how we're doing the online interviews. [REDACTED] ,118
4146,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,7,Interviewee ,We really need like a professional engineer out there. People that know what they're doing. Instead of ,119
4147,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,7,Interviewee ,"just putting people in there and saying, you know, you got to do this, this and that. And that pumphouse ",120
4148,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,7,Interviewee ,"out there is pretty old. You know, it's been there forever. ",121
4149,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,8,Interviewer ,"Okay, that's is it in the plans to put a professional engineer out there, or?  ",122
4150,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,9,Interviewee ,I have no idea. [REDACTED].  ,123
4151,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,10,Interviewer ,"Oh, cool. You think it's an option? ",124
4152,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,11,Interviewee ,"I think that would be a great option. Put them through school, just put that water treatment program and ",125
4153,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,11,Interviewee ,then make them work in that area. ,126
4154,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,12,Interviewer ,Is there do you know if there's a reason why they haven't done that yet? ,127
4155,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,13,Interviewee ,I don't know. Maybe they're picking different opportunities on work. I know a lot of people want to be bio ,128
4156,April 22,Interview 41 ,269,13,Interviewee ,physicists and whatnot. [REDACTED] ,129
4157,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,2,Interviewer ,"Oh cool, that was an option during their training to be able to kind of focus on water and stay in the ",130
4158,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,2,Interviewer ,[REDACTED] area or did most people who took the program then leave? ,131
4159,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,3,Interviewee ,"Oh, I don't know. I don't know about the [REDACTED]? Because, yeah. My work out there was ",132
4160,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,3,Interviewee ,different. ,133
4161,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,4,Interviewer ,"Okay, can you tell me can you tell me about it? What were you? What were you? What were your day ",134
4162,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,4,Interviewer ,to day looking like? What did you do in a day? ,135
4163,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,5,Interviewee ,[REDACTED] ,136
4164,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,6,Interviewee ,"So he's, but yeah, I worry about the people in [REDACTED] and their water. ",137
4165,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,7,Interviewer ,Is that is that one of the biggest problems you think in [REDACTED] is the water? ,138
4166,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,8,Interviewee ,"Yes, the water and I wish the drug stuff went away. And it's all everything, everything in general. ",139
4167,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,9,Interviewer ,"If you could change something, I mean, it could be anything about [REDACTED], but since we're ",140
4168,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,9,Interviewer ,"focused on water, if there's one thing you could change about the water system, what do you think the ",141
4169,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,9,Interviewer ,biggest issue is?  ,142
4170,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,10,Interviewee ,The quality. ,143
4171,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,11,Interviewer ,"And you think it's the quality out coming through the pipes? Because when it's delivered, it sounds like ",144
4172,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,11,Interviewer ,the water qualities maybe okay. But it's primarily through the pipes that it becomes an issue. ,145
4173,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,12,Interviewee ,"Yes, they probably need to be changed. Because those have been there since basically the 70s. ",146
4174,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,13,Interviewer ,Someone had told me that they'd run some kind of test where they decided that they needed to fix ,147
4175,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,13,Interviewer ,corrosion of pipes. And they'd run some kind of chemical through it to line it. But that hadn't fixed it. Do ,148
4176,April 22,Interview 41 ,270,13,Interviewer ,you? Do you remember that happening? ,149
4177,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,1,Interviewee ,"Probably. Probably. It's been a while. Yeah, I think they probably just need new overall new pipes or ",150
4178,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,1,Interviewee ,"some kind that's different, that’s better. ",151
4179,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,2,Interviewer ,"Okay. Yeah. That makes that makes our questions. How did you, what did you think about the ",152
4180,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,2,Interviewer ,affordability of the water? And we kind of said that it's expensive when it's piped and even more when ,153
4181,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,2,Interviewer ,it's hauled? ,154
4182,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,3,Interviewee ,I I think the people are they need assistance for the water or something. They pay too much for ,155
4183,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,3,Interviewee ,"everything out there. It's just hard to live out there, basically.  ",156
4184,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,4,Interviewer ,Yeah. Yeah. Those of everything are high right? For water and internet and gas? ,157
4185,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,5,Interviewee ,Did you go to the stores?  ,158
4186,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,6,Interviewer ,To get food. Yeah. ,159
4187,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,7,Interviewee ,Yeah. The poor kids don't get enough milk. Just cuz of that. That's I worry about all the kids out there. ,160
4188,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,8,Interviewer ,"And everything comes in on the barge or via plane, and that makes things expensive, too. ",161
4189,April 22,Interview 41 ,271,9,Interviewee ,Yeah. That's for sure. Yeah. I really appreciate you doing this for them. ,162
4197,April 22,Interview 5 ,26,2,Interviewer,"Okay, awesome. So, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Where are you from?  ",1

4598,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewer,Okay. And then would you kind of change anything about how you're getting the water  ,53
4589,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,I wish it would be unlimited water.  ,54
4599,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, that's a good part of the town's on pipes right so it's more kind of that unlimited water. ",55
4590,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Mm-hmm (affirmative). But we have that many [inaudible] now. We've got to regulate the water ,56
4591,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,"because it’s the water – cuz people that work for the water company, it's every two weeks that they'll ",57
4592,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,come back and fill it up. I wish it was unlimited water. ,58
4600,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewer,Do you run out of water a lot? ,59
4593,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Sometimes ,60
4601,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewer,Okay. What do you do then? Do you just? ,61
4594,April 22,Interview 8 ,52,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,My grandma has rain buckets outside. ,62
4609,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewer,Do you think that water tastes better than the tap?  ,63
4602,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Anything does. ,64
4610,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewer,Okay so you prefer to actually drink rainwater? ,65
4603,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Yeah.  ,66
4611,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewer,Okay. Do you ever drink rainwater or anything?  ,67
4604,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,[inaudible; likely “yes”] ,68
4612,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewer,Okay. Do you think it tastes better than? ,69
4605,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Mm-hmm (affirmative).  ,70
4613,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewer,Okay. So tap water is not good tasting?  ,71
4606,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Yeah. ,72
4614,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Got it, got it. And then what about kinda seasonally? Is it different? Do you notice any differences ",73
4615,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewer,with the water or your services? ,74
4607,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,I don’t see any difference.  ,75
4616,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewer,Okay. ,76
4608,April 22,Interview 8 ,53,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Always the same to me.  ,77
4625,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,Yeah. And then what about water conservation? Do you feel like you have enough water that you wish ,78
4626,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,you had more water? ,79
4617,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,"Yeah, I’m thirsty right now. ",80
4627,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,I know I wish we had water to give out ,81
4618,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Which company do you guys work for? ,82
4628,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, so we [REDACTED]   ",83
4629,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,"Anyways, so that's why we're talking to people try to understand, you know, what you prefer and what ",84
4630,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,you don't prefer. ,85
4619,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,"But yeah, I prefer rainwater over the city water. ",86
4631,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,Okay. Yeah. Would you like piped water over hauled you think?  ,87
4620,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Yeah because there are times we just run out of water and can’t do nothing about it until they deliver ,88
4621,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,more water.  ,89
4632,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,Yeah. And then what about is it expensive to get the water delivered?  ,90
4622,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,I don't know my grandma does her own bills. ,91
4623,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,[Inaudible]  ,92
4633,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,"Yeah and so you're not used to it here. It's not great, right? Okay, yeah. Well do y'all have any other ",93
4634,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewer,kinds of any questions I haven't asked you that you would like to share about water and? ,94
4624,April 22,Interview 8 ,54,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,What’s going through the system? Rust or? ,95
4643,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewer,Yeah you're worried about kind of like what's in the pipe? And why it tastes so metallic kind of? ,96
4635,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Yeah   ,97
4644,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. A lot about like the quality of the water yeah.  ",98
4636,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,I notice the chlorine and I’d rather [inaudible]. ,99
4645,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewer,So you don't like the chlorine smell and taste? ,100
4637,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Yeah. ,101
4646,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewer,Do y'all feel the same kind of you don't like the chlorination? ,102
4638,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,"Well just sometimes it just tastes like lead or iron, especially in the jail. ",103
4647,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewer,Interesting. Okay. Yeah. So it takes it's interesting that it tastes different between areas of the city. ,104
4639,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Mm-hmm (affirmative). The jail tastes really like iron and lead. Really you could really taste too when ,105
4640,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,you have water in the jail. ,106
4648,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. Do you prefer rainwater the taste? ,107
4641,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,Mm-hmm (affirmative)  ,108
4649,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewer,"You know, when you get rainwater do you usually boil it or do you drink it?  ",109
4642,April 22,Interview 8 ,55,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,We just drink it. We probably don’t have to boil it.  ,110
4653,April 22,Interview 8 ,56,1,Interviewer,And then do you ever worry that any of your water is safe to drink or not like whether rainwater or piped ,111
4654,April 22,Interview 8 ,56,1,Interviewer,or you know hauled water?  ,112
4650,April 22,Interview 8 ,56,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,I don’t think so. ,113
4655,April 22,Interview 8 ,56,1,Interviewer,Okay. Yeah.  ,114
4651,April 22,Interview 8 ,56,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,But water is water. But you have different parts of the area where it tastes different. ,115
4656,April 22,Interview 8 ,56,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay. Got it. Okay, well, is there any other kind of thoughts about water? I don't have many more ",116
4657,April 22,Interview 8 ,56,1,Interviewer,questions.  ,117
4652,April 22,Interview 8 ,56,1,Interviewee 1 or Interviewee 2 or Interviewee 3,I don’t have any.  ,118
4665,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewer,[REDACTED; Introduction] ,1
4666,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewer,Nice. Okay. Are you on piped or hauled water? ,2
4658,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewee,I'm on hauled water. ,3
4667,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewer,Hauled water. Okay. And what kind of frequency of delivery? ,4
4659,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewee,Once a week. ,5
4668,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewer,Once a week. Into a 1000-gallon tank? ,6
4660,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewee,"Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. No, it's three 300 gallons. So, 900 gallons ",7
4669,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewer,And those are the new plastic donut ones? ,8
4661,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewee,Mm-hmm (affirmative).  ,9
4670,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewer,Okay. Do you find that that frequency get enough water? Do you run out of water ever? ,10
4662,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewee,"We probably run out of water twice, maybe three times a year.  ",11
4671,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewer,Okay.  ,12
4663,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewee,"Like, when all the kids are home for college. Holidays, where there's a lot of washing of clothes and ",13
4664,April 22,Interview 9 ,57,2,Interviewee,everybody's bathing and everybody’s home. That kinda stuff. ,14
4685,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay, and what do you do? How do you stop gap it? ",15
4672,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,"It depends on what day it is. If it’s the day before we’re supposed to get scheduled service, then we’ll ",16
4673,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,just do without. I have the ability to haul in like five-gallon jerry jugs. I just get water to flush toilets. You ,17
4674,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,"know, that kinda stuff. If it's more than a day and if the city has the available driver, then we’ll give the ",18
4675,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,haul the next bill.  ,19
4686,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. And that's like a supplementary kind of top up? ,20
4676,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,Yeah. ,21
4687,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewer,And you pay them more for it? ,22
4677,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. We pay more, we pay, yes. ",23
4688,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewer,It’s expensive more for it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And I mean how’s the cost if you find water expensive to ,24
4689,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewer,start with? ,25
4678,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,"I do. Yes. You know, I have some knowledge of what the expenses were. And you know there’s not – ",26
4679,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,my knowledge of the expenses is 15ish years old now. And they're all legitimate expenses. But it's ,27
4680,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,expensive to produce and deliver water in this place. ,28
4690,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewer,"Yeah. So, I mean, with that kind of, how have things changed over time? If you've kind of been here for ",29
4691,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewer,[REDACTED] years? Have you seen a change in the services that like the frequency or the reliability ,30
4692,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewer,or? ,31
4681,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,"Well, the cost has gone up. 15ish years ago, water was for lack of a better term subsidized. So, the city ",32
4682,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,was not charging what it actually cost to produce and deliver the water. That changed about 15 or so ,33
4683,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,"years ago, when the funding that the city got, I'm assuming still gets from the state and the Feds based ",34
4684,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewee,on their requirements that the city charges at least how much it costs to deliver. ,35
4693,April 22,Interview 9 ,58,1,Interviewer,"Oh, interesting. Do you know why? Why they did that? ",36
4694,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. Because it was tied to the funding and the funding said look, if your gonna charge, it’s basically a ",37
4695,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"business model. If you’re losing money, we're not gonna give you cuz sooner or later things are just ",38
4696,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"gonna crash. So, the city implemented over the course of two to three years 20ish, percent price ",39
4697,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"increases, which was kind of a sticker shock. But it brought up to the level that the water sewer was a ",40
4698,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,breakeven. ,41
4716,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay. Okay. And then over time, since that is. ",42
4699,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"And I’m assuming that it’s still the same. Again, my knowledge is 15 years old. ",43
4717,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. Okay. And so, I mean, is there a way apart from one of the ways to bring the cost back ",44
4718,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewer,down? If you feel like -  ,45
4700,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"Well, in my opinion, piped is a cheaper way to go. But it's also very expensive to, to build that ",46
4701,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,infrastructure.  ,47
4719,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewer,Yeah. ,48
4702,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"We were the city was receiving anywhere from a million dollars a year, up to as much as 10 when there ",49
4703,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"was a lot of oil money back in the mid-2000s for infrastructure, of water and sewer. So, [REDACTED] ",50
4704,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"was piped at that time. But in my opinion, it was kind of the low hanging fruit of the consensus. ",51
4705,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"[REDACTED]. So, the delivery right now by truck or back then by truck is your least expensive places in ",52
4706,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,town to deliver by truck cuz they're the closest to the water plants. Now sewer was able to take ,53
4707,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"advantage of the sewer line that runs from [REDACTED] all the way to the sewer, and so they built the ",54
4708,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,lift station out there by the airport. That minimizes a lot of the trucks back and forth. But water has not ,55
4709,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"done that. And I have urged the city to deliver via pipeline. A couple different tapped sources, so that ",56
4710,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"trucks could don't have to make the run all over town, if they could somehow generate a delivery point ",57
4711,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,into the trucks somewhere out in the approximate area where that lift station meets the sewer line and ,58
4712,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,another run on the other side that runs out to [REDACTED]. That'll that'll minimize a lot of truck costs ,59
4713,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"until you can finally get that pipeline. In addition, less wear and tear on your roads because those trucks ",60
4714,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,"are extremely heavy and trucks you know everything. [REDACTED]. But in my opinion, that's one way ",61
4715,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewee,to decrease the cost direction. ,62
4720,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense. That's a we haven't talked specifically about that with them ",63
4721,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewer,but what we should ask on the work just saying. And so do you have any issues with the piped like ,64
4722,April 22,Interview 9 ,59,1,Interviewer,freezing pipes or broken pipes or? ,65
4723,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,"Well, I mean, because we're on a truck system. The freezing is within my house.  ",66
4737,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewer,Within your house. ,67
4724,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,"Yeah. The sewer tank if it's not heated, our sewer tank will freeze when it gets less than about 10 below ",68
4725,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,"or 10 above. So, before we always have to make sure the day before we always have to plug in our ",69
4726,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,tank heater make sure because otherwise the truck comes. Nobody's home. He can't [inaudible; likely ,70
4727,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,"“evac” it. He given us a little blue slip, that says your sewer tank is full. We don't see until that evening ",71
4728,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,"when we get home, but they're done with their day. So that means we've got to pay an extra fee for him ",72
4729,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,to come back once it thaws. That's a pain in the butt. ,73
4738,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewer,"No, I'm sure yeah. For so many reasons. ",74
4730,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,You need a ten?  ,75
4739,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewer,"Yeah, okay. Is your tanks are they all inside or in a shed or something? ",76
4731,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,"The water tanks are inside. It’s heated. Yeah, heated. The water tanks they’re not insulated, but they’re ",77
4732,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,in a heated room. Sewer tank is outside insulated but that [inaudible]. ,78
4740,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. Does that do you ever have issues with lift or floating? ,79
4733,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,"I have not. A couple of properties that I have owned over the years, I do know that it has been. And I ",80
4734,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,think it's just kind of luck of the draw of is it on top of permafrost or not on top of permafrost. You know ,81
4735,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,kinda thing. ,82
4741,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah.  ,83
4742,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewer,"Okay, so some float, but it’s depending on whether you’re located on the permafrost or not when things ",84
4743,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewer,that. ,85
4736,April 22,Interview 9 ,60,1,Interviewee,I think that’s the reason why. I don’t know for sure. ,86
4763,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay.  ,87
4744,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,"Like I said, I've been lucky mine have not floated. ",88
4764,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. And how's the how's the taste of the hot water the taste and color? ,89
4745,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,"Well, two components to that. One is water as it comes out the truck has, in my opinion, high chlorine ",90
4746,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,smell. If it comes directly from the truck and your tank is empty and you're tapping it as soon as it ,91
4747,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,"delivers, yeah, there's a strong chlorine smell to it. I don’t know about taste. So, we have a filter like a ",92
4748,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,Brita filter on our sink that we get tap water from. ,93
4765,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. Nice. And is the color all okay? ",94
4749,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,"Well, the water coming out of the truck is.  ",95
4766,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewer,Okay. ,96
4750,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,But I don't know. I do know that naturally our water has a high iron content. And wildlife. Any coloration ,97
4751,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,"in our water tank, by the time it gets through our shower, the very first time you turn on the showerhead, ",98
4752,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,"the immediate couple seconds, there's a slight orange tinge to it. So, I don't want I don't know is, is that ",99
4753,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,from the water itself before it even came to my house. Or is there some corrosion going on somewhere ,100
4754,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,in the pipes. ,101
4767,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. No that makes sense. ",102
4755,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,"Excuse me. I know [REDACTED]. I had an aunt that lived up there, and her water was tang basically. I ",103
4756,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,"mean it was heavy orange. And 15 years ago, we are working with – the city worked for many years on ",104
4757,April 22,Interview 9 ,61,1,Interviewee,"a mitigation. You know, a lot spent hundreds of thousand dollars on studies on what could fix this. ",105
